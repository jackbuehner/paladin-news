The temperature is finally starting to drop, the leaves are beginning to change, and your favorite autumn produce is at its prime. Produce such as apples, pears, mushrooms, pumpkin and winter squash are all currently in season. Though maybe less noticeably in the fall, in-season produce tends to taste better and hold more nutritional value (think summer vs. winter berries). For a lot of us, these taste and freshness differences guide our buying habits throughout the year.

Global seasonality refers to food that was produced naturally in season (without artificial heat or light) but is not necessarily consumed where it was produced. For example, this term would describe apples produced in China during their growing season then transported to the US for consumption. Local seasonality, however, refers to the production and consumption of produce all in the same place – the type of produce a local farmer’s market would provide. Finally, some produce is grown completely out of season with the help of growing lights and a heated environment.\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"When considering the sustainability of these growing options, one major factor is greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE).

But eating on the go is a big part of college life too, so I’m always packing energy balls, crackers, or a classic — walnuts and a banana.
