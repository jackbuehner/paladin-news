There is often a stigma attached to asking for help or even recognizing that habits such as skipping meals are unhealthy and problematic. At Furman, help is hard to find and potential programs to address food security have been met with resistance in the past.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is unfortunate, especially because we know financial mobility for Furman students from low-income backgrounds into high-income statuses is \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002Finteractive\u002Fprojects\u002Fcollege-mobility\u002Ffurman-university\"\u003Erarely achieved\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

This program would allow students to donate between one and three guest meal swipes to a “swipe bank” in which&nbsp; students facing food insecurity could apply to receive food swipes. The application process would maintain student confidentiality and only a small select internal committee would review applications. Swipes would subsequently be digitally added to a student’s meal card, maintaining privacy for each student that accesses this program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a national level, attention around this issue has been rising. Swipe Out Hunger is the original author and architect of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.swipehunger.org\u002Fhungerfree\u002F\"\u003EHunger-Free Campus Bill\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which passed in California in July 2017, and New Jersey in May 2019. When passed, the bill grants funds to public colleges to implement food security initiatives on campus, such as starting a meal swipe donation program, establishing food pantries, and creating SNAP enrollment opportunities. The legislation has proved effective at addressing student food access, and eight states have recently introduced the bill.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy introducing a program like Swipe Out Hunger, our community would better safeguard campus-wide food security and uplift students’ dignity.

Most residents of the city had never seen the falls, which were hidden by an ugly motor vehicle bridge.

Greenville didn’t go bankrupt. The park has provided a beautiful recreational space for residents and visitors, spurred economic development, and defined Greenville’s identity as a city. When people think of Greenville, they think of Falls Park. The City Council had a long-term vision, and they invested their time, money and energy accordingly. After a year of COVID-19 disruption, what would it mean for student organizations at Furman to embrace this kind of strategic spending?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost non-Greek student organizations have clearly defined missions, regardless of where the money in their coffers comes from. Some, like the Furman University Outdoors Club (FUOC), are independent, while others are subsidiaries of larger umbrella organizations like Club Sports, Religious Council (RC) and the Student Diversity Council (SDC). Having an obvious goal makes budgeting decisions straightforward. The club basketball team, for instance, exists to promote club basketball, and their budget reflects that: their expenditures are almost exclusively devoted to team travel and competition.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy contrast, the Furman University Student Activities Board (FUSAB) — one of the oldest, largest and most influential organizations on campus — has a much broader mission. According to their \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffurman.campuslabs.com\u002Fengage\u002Forganization\u002Ffurman-university-student-activities-board\"\u003ESyncDin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E page, they are dedicated to providing “entertainment for the student body according to campus interests” and “opportunities for students to have experiences that they may not otherwise have.” The breadth of this mission is not inherently bad, but it does present additional challenges as FUSAB plans, budgets and executes its events.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFUSAB has had decades of practice at fulfilling its mission of providing entertainment for the student body and making positive contributions to student life. Toast and Jams does a wonderful job each year of elevating hidden musical talents in our midst. The annual HAVOC competition is not only entertaining but also energizes students of all stripes to participate in charitable giving. And despite the outcome of the game, gathering students in Timmons Arena last month to watch the men’s basketball team take on Wofford in Spartanburg was a textbook good FUSAB idea. According to FUSAB President Sam Gary, 230 students — nearly 10% of the on-campus student population — attended that event. Not all entertainment will appeal to all students, but these are broadly popular examples of FUSAB making our campus better.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis year, FUSAB’s budget shrank due to lower student enrollment. They \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thepaladin.news\u002Farticles\u002Fsgas-covid-19-budget-breakdown\"\u003Ereceived\u003C\u002Fa\u003E $140,000 from the Student Government Association (SGA) last semester and about $120,000 this semester. Aside from the weekly Wednesdays on the Mall, their most prominent events this semester have been Datamatch, Tag, the basketball watch party and Among Us — each of which had a budget of $2000 or less, Gary said.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFUSAB’s response to less-than-ideal circumstances has been creative and even frugal, but it is hard to discern a coherent strategy underlying their spending. As COVID-19 has hampered their ability to offer interactive in-person events, the organization has increasingly turned to auctioning items off in raffles and handing them out at random. Needless to say, while giveaways like these boost event attendance and provide a nifty solution to a budget surplus, they are also economically inefficient. In the fall, I walked up to a FUSAB tent outside the Trone Student Center and received Keurig pods for a coffee maker I don’t have and a jumprope that, despite my best intentions, I have yet to take out of its package. This semester, the high-dollar Datamatch prizes even included a TV. One of the prizes at the basketball watch party was a Nike backpack containing a sweatshirt and a bluetooth speaker.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there’s nothing wrong with those things, it is unclear how they fit into FUSAB’s larger mission, particularly given that their budget comes out of students’ pockets in the form of fees paid to SGA. The students who showed up to the watch party would have been there even if it had just been the game and a box dinner. They were there for an experience, not a chance to win. At the end of the day, students crave memorable, communal experiences that allow them to grow and connect with others. As the pandemic draws to a close, all student organizations — whether they deal with entertainment, sports, academics, faith, or something else entirely — should spend strategically with that end in mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb1e",name:"Furman Has An Address Problem",slug:"furman-has-an-address-problem",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-03-18T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df7c4f59fe1d47b0621618",name:"Michael Peeler",slug:"michael-peeler",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fmichael-peeler_2021-03-21.jpg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Our lack of an address makes campus harder to navigate in an emergency and puts students's lives at risk.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002FFU1.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"3300 Poinsett Highway isn't enough.",photo_credit:"Furman News",body:"\u003Cp\u003EAs most students on campus could probably tell you, Furman is located at 3300 Poinsett Highway. It is the address of our front gates, the address written on letters received by the P2X, the address of our academic buildings, and the address for all student housing buildings, from South Housing to North Village. So far as I can readily tell, it is the address of nearly every campus building, excluding perhaps the Furman University Police Department and Shi Center. 3300 Poinsett is all of Furman University.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust after 2 a.m. on Saturday, one of my hallmates had a medical emergency. It was an emergency that required us to call 911, one that required paramedics to get to their room as quickly as possible. We needed to communicate our exact location to someone unfamiliar with Furman’s campus — and we did not have a clear way to do this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I spoke frantically with the operator at the other end of the line, she asked for an address to send the paramedics to. “3300 Poinsett Highway,” I told her. “Furman University Campus. Clark Murphy Complex. Townes.”&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“I need a building number,” she responded. “What road are you off of?

All I could do was repeat, “Clark Murphy. Townes. We don’t have a building number.”&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe paramedics were eventually able to get to our hall—but only after we guided the operator through the turns they needed to make to get through the traffic circle at the entrance of campus, ran to the front of Judson to wave in the EMTs, and lead them through the maze of doors and stairways that is Clark Murphy. But in those minutes when my hallmate needed medical help, and the EMTs needed their location, we did not have a good way to share it. There was not an address we could quickly spit out or a clear message we could give to those trying to reach us.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the wake of the emergency, I reached out to the FUPO dispatch to see what Furman recommends in an emergency. The dispatcher I spoke with recommended we call them in an emergency, and that they could share the GPS address of the buildings with EMS dispatch when requesting it themselves. But in emergencies, when instinct takes over, most students will not have the time or wherewithal to look up and call 864-294-2111. I certainly did not consider calling a third party when trying to get the emergency services here. What we all know to do is call 911 — and yet, the current Furman infrastructure does not provide a good way to clearly identify our whereabouts when we do this.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am uncertain as to why Furman has foregone unique addresses for each building on campus. It could be an oversight, it could be a relic from when campus had but a few buildings, or it could be a decision that prioritized uniform aesthetics over actual utility. Whatever the reasoning, it is a decision that makes campus harder to navigate in an emergency, one that could well put the lives of students at risk. Clark Murphy is lucky, since it is at the front of campus, clearly visible from the campus entrance. But what about Trone? What about North Village K, or Blackwell or the Greenbelt? How do you direct an ambulance to one of these buildings while panicked in an emergency, when these buildings do not have their own addresses?

Some seem to refrain from asking these questions at all due to an overly pessimistic view that discounts evidence of genuinely good news. Others simply breezes past these questions in a rush to reopen. Reflecting on our experience and learning from it is more difficult than returning to a pre-pandemic normal, but it is precisely what good faith members of our community are called to do in this moment.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne lesson I have learned during COVID-19 as graduation approaches is that our time in college is precious. Of course, time is always precious. But these four years in college strike me as especially unique in their ability to shape our souls as we approach the rest of our adult lives. Administrators and professors know this. It is why many of them chose to work in a college setting, especially one that is as focused on the student experience as Furman. Students, especially seniors, also have a sense for how impactful college can be. It is evident in our own souls and visible in the four-year transformations that we see in our friends and classmates. For better or worse, college changes us.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat transformation will occur regardless of whether we study away or stay on campus. The impact of these four years has much less to do with the number of Furman Advantage “experiences” that we collect than with how we engage in those experiences and interact with those around us. Let me explain the only way I know how, with a story.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo of the best decisions I made at Furman were to study away my sophomore Fall and to not study away my junior Spring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a tumultuous freshman year, I chose to go to Brussels, Belgium for an internship program on the recommendation of the professor who would be leading the trip. I knew the professor well, trusted his judgement, and wanted to learn more from him about politics, religion and life. Our group had a wonderful trip and traveled all across Europe. The truth is, though, we could have enjoyed the trip almost anywhere. The most valuable aspects of that semester were not the beer, the museums, or the opportunity to work in Europe’s capital, but rather the deep chats over beer, the reflection inspired by great art, and the chance to read in the Bois de La Cambre.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy time in Europe helped me become aware of what really matters in life; it taught me to value community and the simple joy of a deep conversation more than experiences and the pleasures of travel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent the rest of my sophomore year and my junior fall pursuing relationships with people rather than seeking more Furman Advantage hands-on experiences. I took on a more prominent role at \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E; I built relationships with professors and other people that I admired; I met my girlfriend. In other words, I laid my roots at Furman.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd still, by the time my junior Spring came around, I felt that itch again — that sense of restlessness and feeling of inadequacy induced by a culture that despises commitment and a school that too often seems to measure the success of its students by the number of activities they can balance before becoming completely overwhelmed. I was not quite sure why, but for some reason it seemed like I \u003Cem\u003Eneeded\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to study abroad, again. It seemed like I needed to leave for the sake of leaving.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I asked the people that I loved and respected for their opinions, they almost all said that I should stay. For the second time during my four years at Furman, I listened. With just days to spare, I pulled out of the trip and stayed on campus. And that spring, the relationships and institutions I had been investing time in began to bear even more fruit.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf studying abroad my sophomore Fall was a great decision, deciding to stay on campus my junior Spring was an even better choice. My point is that the most impactful aspects of our time in college are not the experiences that we list on our resumes but the relationships that leave indelible marks on our souls and the conversations that leave warmth in our hearts. Those relationships and conversations can happen anywhere, under almost any circumstances.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudying away can be a great experience for certain students. But it is not good in and of itself; and we should stop treating it that way. I have learned this lesson again during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been more restricted than ever this year with many of us confined to campus; and still, perhaps because of the dwindling number of distractions, I have had incredible conversations and made great friends.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I would have preferred not to finish college during a pandemic. But I cannot help but recognize that COVID-19 has helped me see even more clearly what really matters. As students understandably seek a speedy “return to normal,” they would do well to reflect on what they have learned from the past year. Perhaps they will come to a similar conclusion and realize that college is what we make of it. The things that really matter are things that can never be taken away.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdac4",name:"It’s the Little Things",slug:"its-the-little-things",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-03-11T07:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df78fd59fe1d47b062160d",name:"Bella Dickenson",slug:"bella-dickenson",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fbella-dickenson_2021-03-21.jpg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Now that Furman is at a place where we can lessen some COVID-19 restrictions, we can now experience some of the little things we have been lacking.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002FIMG_8156.JPG.jpg",photo_caption:"As the weather warms and the flowers bloom, let’s use the outdoor spaces we have to safely put on more student events.",photo_credit:"Owen Kowalewski ",body:"\u003Cp\u003EOn one of my walks a couple days ago, I noticed something strange, something I had not noticed in quite a long time. The soccer and rugby teams were scrimmaging, the track team was running laps, and in the distance, I could hear muffled music from the football stadium. People were sitting outside, on blankets, chairs and hammocks. Others were playing volleyball, basketball, and spikeball. All of a sudden, campus seemed to me filled with life, a bustling hum of activity long overdue. I finally felt as though things were \u003Cem\u003Ehappening\u003C\u002Fem\u003E around me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, maybe the positive feeling I experienced on this walk was simply the result of the warmer weather. And perhaps I now have a heightened sensitivity to the presence of people due to decreased social interaction. But, I would not be lying if I said that this semester feels much more alive than the last. What accounts for this new sense of liveliness? I think it is the little changes that have taken place this semester. Most people attest that the smallest things can make or break your day, whether it is a kind note from a friend, or the unfortunate spilling of some coffee. Now that Furman is at a place where we can lessen some of our COVID-19 restrictions, we can now experience some of the little things we have been lacking.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have sorely missed doing so-called normal things, like going out to eat, having parties and spending time with friends and loved ones without the fear of transmitting a virus. We no longer take what once was typical for granted. But, with the end of the pandemic in sight, these small, normal activities are starting to return. Compared to last semester, there are now more events, more new ways to meet other students and more options for dining and exercise. We can now go to football games. We can watch plays outdoors in person. We can swim in the Physical Activities Center. We can enjoy the pasta bar in the Dining Hall or nachos from the food trucks that make rounds from dorm to dorm. There are even events, such as the one a couple days ago, where we can spend time with adorable cats! (As a cat lover, I was simply ecstatic about this one!) And, though they are no replacement for our usual breaks, we now have mental health days that provide a bit of respite from the academic grind. These are all changes that have brought a bit of joy as we go about our life at Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of these changes are drastic alterations to our daily lives, nor are they solutions to some of the campus’ bigger problems. However, though these things are seemingly small, they have great value. They give us little moments of surprise, delight and camaraderie in a time when all of these are sorely lacking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy challenge to the Furman community is to keep on implementing these pleasant little changes as this year goes on. As the weather warms and the flowers bloom, let’s use the outdoor spaces we have to safely put on more student events. Let’s keep having food trucks and gradually expanding the DH. Let’s keep on attending sporting events and putting on plays. And as the virus begins to subside, let’s use these little things to breathe life back into our campus.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb35",name:"Graduation Decision Signals Optimism ",slug:"graduation-decision-signals-optimism",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-03-05T07:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df7c4f59fe1d47b062161c",name:"Nik Stojkovski",slug:"nik-stojkovski",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fnik-stojkovski_2021-03-21.jpg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"This move is the best Furman could have made given the circumstances.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002Fgrad.jpg.jpg",photo_caption:"After being unceremoniously mailed their diplomas and sent on their way, the Class of 2020 will have the opportunity to return to campus for their commencement.",photo_credit:"Furman News. ",body:"\u003Cp\u003EOver the last year, we have all missed out on important events in our lives as a result of the pandemic. One of the closest to home here at Furman was the Class of 2020’s graduation. After four years of work, their graduation ceremony was indefinitely postponed. Their accomplishments seemed to be for naught; they were unceremoniously mailed their diplomas and sent on their way.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, almost a year later, both the Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 received some good \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thepaladin.news\u002Farticles\u002Fadministration-intends-to-hold-in-person-commencement-ceremonies-for-20-and-21-graduates\"\u003Enews\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: according to an email faculty received, the University has started to prepare plans for an in-person graduation ceremony this May. The current senior class and last year’s will have separate ceremonies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis move is the best Furman could have made, given the circumstances, to make up for the cancellation of last year’s ceremony. While some of the Class of 2020 may, as has been expressed, feel that this makeup graduation comes a bit too late, it is still nice to see that last year’s graduates will have an event that allows them to celebrate their achievements with their peers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the group that was probably the most excited to hear this news was the parents of the previous and soon-to-be graduates. Graduation serves as the transition between the end of most students’ academic careers and the beginning of their independent adult lives. For many families, this ceremony is one of the last major milestones in their child’s life before they strike out on their own. In addition, unless their child decides to pursue a graduate degree, graduation serves as a celebration of the culmination of their child’s academic career; they worked toward that moment from kindergarten all the way until the end of their senior year. By postponing graduation last year, this important coming of age tradition was seemingly lost for this class of students and their parents. Now, however, the families that lamented the loss of last year’s celebrations will still be able to see their child walk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis development is also good news for those that aren’t graduating this year. Until now, there have been few in-person events on campus, and hardly any of them came close to the size of a graduation. If Furman is planning on hosting an event of that size on campus, that is hopefully a good sign for things to come. They would not be planning an event like this if they did not foresee improved conditions by the time of graduation. If they are willing to allow an event of this size, perhaps they will allow more in-person events of a smaller nature in the near future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile no plans have been set in stone, the fact that any plans are being made for an in-person ceremony at all is a welcome sign, regardless of if you’ll be graduating in May or not. While those at the end of their academic career have something to look forward to in the coming months, everyone on campus can begin looking towards the future optimistically, as this announcement could signal an increase in in-person events and a beginning of a return to normalcy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdba4",name:"As the Pandemic Ends, Let's Keep Zoom as an Option",slug:"as-the-pandemic-ends-lets-keep-zoom-as-an-option",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-03-02T07:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc53",name:"Jonathan McKinney",slug:"jonathan-mckinney",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Furman needs to start thinking seriously about what role Zoom could play in a post-pandemic world.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002FScreen%2520Shot%25202021-03-02%2520at%252011.40.11%2520AM.png.jpg",photo_caption:"Zoom has been remarkably convenient.",photo_credit:"PicMonkey",body:"\u003Cp\u003EI had mistimed my run. It was Tuesday; Yuval Levin's lecture, which I had been looking forward to for months, was at five. Yet here I was, at 4:53 p.m., out of breath, covered in sweat, and at least ten minutes from any lecture hall. Thank God there was a pandemic going on. I showered in five minutes and logged into the Zoom lecture while still brushing my hair.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, I took the opportunity to multitask. Some dishes had piled up in the sink and had been sitting there for far too long. I set to work, earbuds in, listening to Dr. Levin as if on a podcast. Of course, barely ten minutes in, he said something that struck me and I dashed immediately to my bedroom to grab my blue spiral-bound. I kept it right there on the counter, too, scribbling down thoughts and questions intermittently. But by the end of the lecture, not only had I arrived on time for an enriching educational experience, but my dishes were clean, my clothes were folded, and half my floor was swept.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA year ago, I fully expected Zoom classes to be terrible. In many ways, they have been; just try having a seminar-style class without even being able to see all the participants, or a small group discussion where the audio lags - or worse, where only half the group is on Zoom. And I won't deny that the private chat feature at times presents a major temptation. But Zoom has also been remarkably convenient. That same chat feature, for instance, is really useful for slipping in minor points without making a major disruption. I have often witnessed students, literally running late, pop onto the Zoom call from their phones as they dash across campus; others have logged in audio-only from their car while driving. (Some situations are unavoidable; having that digital option lets students show their professors powerfully that a one-time absence or tardiness is not for lack of caring.) These days, the ability to be quarantined in another state and still not miss class is indispensable. But even in non-COVID times, health-related absences happen. With Zoom, they don't have to mean a mountain of make-up work and an administrative headache on the side.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs vaccine distribution picks up and we approach the light at the end of this long, dark tunnel, Furman needs to start thinking seriously about what role Zoom could play in a post-pandemic world. Now, Furman is not the University of Phoenix, and I doubt either the students or the trustees would stand for a transition to that school's all-online model. That is simply not what Furman students pay for — and with this in mind, professors should stop offering&nbsp; asynchronous or online-only formats in the coming semesters. Instead, they should offer students the best of both worlds: have classes meet primarily in-person, but keep a Zoom link open and ready as a convenient option for those who might need it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the world has transitioned into the Internet Era these past decades, Furman has not fallen behind. Recruiters reach out to potential students on social media. Classes are supplemented with online platforms such as Moodle and Box. Even the student newspaper is now digital — and thriving. Now Zoom gives students the option to attend class virtually if they need to. Once upon a time, providing students with that kind of service would have been an impossible pipe dream. But the digital infrastructure is here, the training is in place, and the students are accustomed to it.

They continued to work, write and meet deadlines, even when their lights flickered out and their internet connections failed. They imparted necessary information and stories to the people living in the center of the disaster, as well as to the nation. They kept on writing so that households plunged into darkness would not be kept in the dark, metaphorically speaking. The events in Texas right now are merely the most recent example of journalists bringing truth and knowledge to the populace in times of emergency.

Last week on the podcast, I interviewed David Trone, who represents Maryland’s 6th district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Here are some things to listen for:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou may recognize Trone’s name: the Trone Student Center was funded in large part by his donation. In 2016, he ran the most expensive ever self-funded campaign for Congress — and lost in the Democratic primary in the 8th district. (He subsequently won his current seat in 2018 and again in 2020.)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI asked Trone why, after a successful business career, he decided to run for Congress. He replied that other forms of philanthropy aren’t “moving the needle in the way that I want to move it.” His position on the House Appropriations Committee allows him to influence the spending of billions of dollars more than he could ever hope to spend on his own.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe far right and the far left are both “cancers” to their respective parties that are largely enabled by gerrymandering and campaign finance rules, Trone said.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHe also indicated that the ills of our polarized political climate might subside somewhat if members from opposite parties spent more time together. While that is certainly a worthy endeavor and may help around the edges, I am skeptical. Personal camaraderie by itself cannot rectify the institutional challenges that our government faces.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETrone speaks with the directness and energy of an experienced businessman, and that outlook has shaped how he views his role in Congress.

The men opened up about daily life and their relationships in prison, their experiences as incarcerated people re-entering society, and anecdotes demonstrating how prison can be chaotic and traumatic.&nbsp; Their experiences as “Voices From the Inside” gave students a glimpse into life behind and beyond bars.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conversation began with Damien, a 34-year-old and father of four, who described the “purity” of the relationships within prison because people get to know each other at their lowest point. He emphasized how important companionship is when in prison, “to get you through your hard times.” He said, “everybody needs somebody...to vent to.”&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon re-entering society after incarceration, Damien mentioned that life might throw you some curveballs. Juan, also a father who has been incarcerated for 28 of his 42 years, offered insight into how difficult re-entering society can be, especially without family support. When navigating the transition, acquiring simple documents like an ID, a birth certificate, or a social security card becomes an obstacle, “the curveballs come so fast, you don’t even see it coming.”&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the Q&amp;A later in the conversation, a student posed the question, “what is one stereotype about prison or incarcerated people that you wished was debunked?” Damien immediately answered, “That we’re all just animals… That we’re cold-hearted, murderers, just bad people… I don’t think people consider the circumstances surrounding our [incarceration].”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Lafourche, the Inside-Out Program transitioned to a virtual format in late Spring 2020.

Through this exchange, students respond to prompts in the format of a letter to share their life experiences and perspectives. In return, they receive a response written by a student at the opposite institution.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConzelmann said being able to “read how someone thinks … and getting to learn about their life” has sparked a deeper capacity to “see incarcerated people as people,” which she says is the center of FPEP’s goal.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExchanging a letter enables incarcerated individuals and people not incarcerated to form an authentic connection, “it makes it more personal.” It’s “humanizing, and can change the way we think about people who are incarcerated… and our criminal justice system,” said Conzelmann. FPEP’s writing exchange is open to any Furman student who wishes to participate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESydney Kittrell became engaged with FPEP’s work out of a genuine curiosity about incarcerated life and a desire to think about the criminal justice system from a perspective of empathy. Kittrell said events such as this CLP are invaluable for transforming our perception of incarcerated people from “numbers or statistics” to seeing them like “stories, and people that I have some sort of connection to.” She continued by expressing how important it is for Furman students to step outside of their world, and consider realities apart from their own.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMorris emphasized how “bringing people into the prison is a powerful thing, but we’ve been able to meet a much broader audience” through virtual gatherings and CLPs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the final questions from the student audience asked the men on the panel to share what they think needs to be done to reform the prison system. Juan said we need more open-minded conversations with incarcerated people to deconstruct prejudice and stereotypes. “What we’re doing right now, that plays a big part,” Mack stressed the importance of supporting vulnerable people in the community. “If you motivate [individuals] and stand behind them, they’re gonna feel like they mean something.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen introducing himself, Damien said he hoped to “provide students with a window to the realities of the criminal justice system in America,” and their dialogue on Tuesday night did just that. Meeting others' experiences with an open mind is powerful. Kittrell says students must grapple with: “This is real. Do you care? Do you have empathy for this?” Encountering “three lives that are drastically different from yours” forms this opportunity.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJunior Joe Wilson reflected on the importance of attending events that educate students about the criminal justice system, “because, like me, you will learn how unjust this system truly is.” He added, “this was the most engaging and beneficial CLP I’ve been to at Furman, and I can’t wait for another FPEP event.” Many students shared similar sentiments and expressed how dialogue with Damien, Juan, and Mack, challenged and expanded the way they think about incarcerated people.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E·&nbsp; &nbsp; \t·&nbsp; &nbsp; \t·\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman’s inaugural Inside-Out course will launch in Spring 2022 in partnership with Perry Correctional Institution.

Descriptions of national and international success decorate the university’s website like medals on a war hero’s uniform. However, among all the honors and distinctions, there is something off about how the university presents itself. Like unshined brass on the decorated soldier’s uniform, Furman’s identity as a university in Greenville, South Carolina, seems to be clouded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecruitment of South Carolina students is notably lacking. Despite being a university in South Carolina, the composition of the student body only residually reflects this fact; the proportion of in-state students at Furman is noticeably low. Most other schools in the state have a majority of their students coming from South Carolina, displaying the fact on their websites. For example, Clemson boasts 58% in-state enrollment, and the University of South Carolina and Wofford are just behind at 56%. Furman, on the other hand, does not even list in-state enrollment on their website. Instead, they group Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina together. For example, the Class of 2023 profile lists the percentage of students coming from these states to be 47%. According to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.petersons.com\u002Fcollege-search\u002Ffurman-university-000_10004061.aspx\"\u003EPeterson’s\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.niche.com\u002Fcolleges\u002Ffurman-university\u002Fstudents\u002F\"\u003ENiche\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, Furman’s in-state enrollment is around half of that, listing it at 30% and 26% respectively.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are not the only numbers that separate Furman from its home state. According to Furman’s website, the total direct cost of attendance — not including books or personal living expenses — is $66,214. In contrast, according to census data, South Carolina’s median household income is $53,199, a paltry sum compared to the massive $181,500 median household income at Furman. While Furman does grant a fair amount of aid to students who need it, the price tag alone is cause for many South Carolinians to balk at the thought of applying.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile finding talented students from out of state can prove to be a boon to any university, every school’s primary focus should be the development and recruitment of students from their home state, with an emphasis on the local community. In-state students have more of an incentive to remain in South Carolina due to family ties and other connections they have made throughout their life. As a result, they will use the knowledge and skills they learned while at Furman to help improve their communities that give back directly to Furman, whether that community be Greenville or just South Carolina in general. By training the future businessman, state congresswoman, and other local and state leaders, Furman can reap the fruit of their students’ labor while also giving back to their home state, developing a positive symbiotic relationship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not mean to attack or belittle out-of-state students in any capacity. Their presence is not a problem, and they contribute to campus in meaningful ways. Rather, the problem lies with the university’s recruitment and admissions policies. Furman seems to have an identity conflict. It is not an identity \u003Cem\u003Ecrisis\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, as that would overstate the urgency of the issue, but there is a conflict in Furman’s identity nonetheless. Whether intentional or not, Furman seems to be distancing itself from its identity as a South Carolina university. When in-state students are such a small minority group on a campus in their own state, the university’s priorities should be called into question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb1f",name:"Into The Archives: Digitized Newspapers Provide Link To The Past",slug:"into-the-archives-digitized-newspapers-provide-link-to-the-past",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-02-17T07:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df7c4f59fe1d47b0621618",name:"Michael Peeler",slug:"michael-peeler",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fmichael-peeler_2021-03-21.jpg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Although decades separate us from students of Furman’s past, the online records Furman keeps provide an incredible window into our school’s history.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002Fhornet%25201.jpg.jpg",photo_caption:"The first issue of The Paladin, originally called The Hornet, features a story about Furman's sports rivalry with Wofford.

COVID-19 has led to a near complete transformation of campus life, uprooting many of the essential elements of a liberal education. It is difficult to host in-person classes and facilitate fruitful group discussions. Students have lost access to common spaces where they once gathered in community. Our public square is far from crowded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough disappointing, this is no cause for despair. In fact, we might allow this crisis to sharpen our focus on the things that really matter, just as other crises have done for great thinkers throughout history.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that spirit, then, it should be said that the real challenge confronting liberal education at Furman is more fundamental and persistent than COVID-19. At heart, that challenge is one of self-definition. We claim to be a liberal arts school in our brochure, but what does that mean to us in practice? That is a question that thoughtful members of our community have struggled with long-before COVID-19 and one that I hope they will continue to address. For now, in my opinion, our answer falls short.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman does get some things right about liberal education. Our residential community, small classes, and student-professor relationships lay a strong foundation not only for acquiring knowledge but for gaining wisdom. Furman also enjoys an increasingly diverse student body, which has the potential to serve as a fertile field for the good-spirited disagreements necessary for liberal education. What’s more, our student body is not only diverse, but engaged. Paladins tend to be seriously involved in at least one student organization.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt their best, these organizations funnel student energy into reflective and constructive activities that lead to practical, community-facing projects for positive change. Unfortunately, however, many on-campus organizations are failing to fulfill this important role. This is because, broadly speaking, Furman knows what liberal education requires but often fails to communicate what it is. We have all the ingredients, but often our chefs are not all on the same page about what we are making. As a senior, I feel confident saying that many members of the student body seem blissfully unaware of the transformational process of “liberal education” that they have supposedly been engaged in.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the environment on campus is capable of affecting students to a surprising extent, habituating them into virtue without their knowing. But ultimately, liberal education is about creating perceptive people that are capable of contemplation and choice. How can we claim to be fulfilling our mission if so many students are \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eaware of what liberal education is and even fewer are consciously choosing to participate in it?&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe cannot. We can, however, more consciously communicate our commitment to liberal education. In practice, this sort of effort could take many forms. But no matter what form it takes, I think it will require our community to do two things that it may be somewhat uncomfortable with.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we need to abandon the “playground” mentality, which posits that campus is a place where students are first and foremost meant to live comfortable, easy lives. This approach encourages an ever-expanding array of resources and amenities for students, but it neglects to give them any direction about how to choose a good path. It would rather students be comfortable than curious. It would rather students be entertained than innovative.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, Furman needs to stop trying to be something it's not. Furman is a small, regional liberal arts school in the South. That is our identity, and we should own it. When we do not own our identity as a Southern regional school, it seems to me that we also tend to move further away from offering a truly liberal education. In expanding our ambition, we actually dilute our aims. That is not to say that we should stop recruiting international students or seeking people from all walks of life. But, I am suggesting that South Carolina — and the South more broadly — are our home and they have a lot to offer that we are not taking full advantage of. That includes immense racial and socioeconomic diversity, a rich history full of lessons and warnings for students today, and a profound sense of rootedness. Diversity, history, and rootedness are all key aspects of a liberal education. If we lean into our identity, we are bound to lean into liberal education as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECOVID-19 will come and go, but questions about liberal education will remain. How Furman answers those questions will determine whether we merely pay lip service to liberal education in our mission statement or if liberal education will be a living breathing and defining aspect of campus life. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdac3",name:"Furman’s Campus Isn’t Looking So Great, and That’s Okay ",slug:"furmans-campus-isnt-looking-so-great-and-thats-okay",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-02-11T07:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df78fd59fe1d47b062160d",name:"Bella Dickenson",slug:"bella-dickenson",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fbella-dickenson_2021-03-21.jpg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"We are acting as stewards, preserving and extending the livelihood of our campus for our posterity to enjoy. ",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002Fcontent.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"Needless to say, Furman is not at its best right now.",photo_credit:"Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003EFurman’s campus is known for its beauty.

These daily walks provided time to contemplate and talk to friends and family, all while admiring the world around me.

The grand trees that once adorned the Mall have now been uprooted and replaced. The plaza in front of the library is being rebuilt, surrounded by fences. The lake is now scattered with pink buoys and yellow barriers. The area on the other side of the lake now features a strange rubber, black, pillow-like object surrounded by red clay.

This trust is not just based on the qualifications of the medical professionals guiding these decisions or the good intentions of the professors making up the committee. It is also influenced by the way that the committee’s actions are perceived by the students.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the students I have spoken to over the past two weeks have been displeased with at least some portion of the committee’s decisions. Some standards have felt too restrictive and others too lenient. The most essential standards, like restricting group size or staying on campus, are the least enforceable. The newly relaxed areas, like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thepaladin.news\u002Farticles\u002Fwhy-furman-should-invest-in-outdoor-dining\"\u003Eindoor dining\u003C\u002Fa\u003E or the PAC, appear to have some of the highest risks. In addition, many of the remaining restricted activities, such as in-person club meetings, feel far safer than recently deregulated ones.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot say for certain why such attitudes persist on campus — we may simply be angsty teens and twenty-somethings who miss the freedom we became accustomed to last semester. But after rereading communications from the committee, at least part of this lack of confidence boils down to a public messaging problem.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA key principle in business, marketing, and opinion column writing is to under-promise in your pitch, and over-deliver in your product. The committee appears to have inadvertently done the exact opposite when they wrote in their first email this semester that “until at least January 25, we will operate in a low-to-no-contact phase on campus.” In hindsight, it is clear that they tried to leave the length of the “low-to-no-contact” phase ambiguous so they could extend it as the need arised. But many students, myself included, took this line to mean that we would be returning to normal operations after the first week. After all, they \u003Cem\u003Eonly \u003C\u002Fem\u003Esaid the restrictions would be in effect until Jan. 25. When we received the email a week later stating that “low-to-no-contact” would be extended by a week, it felt like the committee had not just under-delivered, but had completely yanked the rug out from under our feet. Our eagerness to dine with friends, work out at the PAC, and begin holding club events was wiped out, replaced quickly with the anger and discontent that came alongside falling flat on our faces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother communication principle that the committee appears to have violated in their messaging is a favorite of the U.S. Navy, referred to by the acronym KISS: for the purposes of this article, “Keep It Simple and Straightforward.” In theory, the Operational Phase system makes sense if everyone has a general idea of the rules and expectations for each color. The committee says a color, and we follow those restrictions until the color is changed. It is a simple method, in theory. But the committee removed that simplicity last week when they began subdividing phases and enacted a “modified Orange Phase” that was a Frankenstein’s monster of stitched-together rules and phases. The effort to give students more freedom is noble and well-received, but its implementation has been befuddling. By introducing a dozen caveats to the restrictions of the phase we were already in, the committee hindered its ability to communicate clearly just as students were beginning to adjust to the new system. If the committee wants to use the Operational Phases system, they should stick to their definitions. Currently, they are trying to fit a square peg into a diamond-shaped hole, and while it may be possible, it causes extra work, requires good whittling skills, and leaves everyone more frustrated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe committee seems to have inspired discontent in the student body so far, and that is the last emotion they should want us feeling while trying to convince us to follow their essential precautions. The committee should stop being vague in its claims about how long a restriction may last, trying to reserve the ability to shift the goals; that only furthers the discontent and leads to misunderstanding. They should either stick to the Operation Phases as they laid it out, or abandon the system and just tell us what the restrictions are each week, because their attempts to straddle the line with the current restrictions have simply been confusing. And they should keep in mind that our trust in them is not shaped just by their expertise, knowledge, and rationale, which they surely have in spades, but also by the way we perceive their actions and statements, something that seems to have been lacking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdab5",name:"Why Furman Should Invest in Outdoor Dining",slug:"why-furman-should-invest-in-outdoor-dining",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-02-01T07:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61095711a50d4c001593d9a2",name:"Price St. Clair",slug:"price-st-clair",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fuploads-ssl.webflow.com\u002F5f37fcdc1b6edd6760ad912f\u002F5f6802b32596dd5c895a88de_price-stclair.jpg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"If looking out for our neighbors and fellow students means spending more time outside, we should do it.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F60182e98e76bb1ffa5382ff1_DH.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"The DH is open, but that does not mean you should eat inside during the common hour — quite the opposite, in fact.",photo_credit:"Owen Kowalewski",body:"\u003Cp\u003EOn Friday, a Furman Focused email announced that “we have contained on-campus disease prevalence, [and] we are going to lift and\u002For modify several restrictions.” Like most of you, I took this as good news, even as I was slightly confused as to why we remain in the Orange phase.

While we had a great semester for coronavirus cases in the fall, boasting some of the lowest numbers of any university in the state, we face a different situation than we did in the fall. The virus’s presence has increased significantly in the Greenville area since we were last on campus, so the administration has made some changes. Specifically, new rules, some temporary and some permanent, have been introduced, such as the limiting of in-person interaction to pods of four. However, out of all of Furman’s regulations this semester, the most damaging to the academic success and mental health of the students is the lack of a spring break.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs several people pointed out last semester, the pandemic has had a disastrous effect on student mental health. While there are several factors at play in this, such as the lack of social interaction, the cancellation of potential events, and, worst of all, the loss of friends or family, the biggest academic impact on the entirety of the student body was the complete lack of any break during the semester. Not only were we expected to follow the new rules Furman implemented to the letter, but we also were expected to do this without any time off to take a rest. As a result, the typical mid-semester slump arrived sooner and harder, staying for longer than it would normally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to combat the fatigue experienced in the fall, Furman has implemented monthly no-class days. Including the established Good Friday holiday, students have three days off during the semester - Feb. 18, Mar. 10, and Apr. 2, meaning that the administration only designated two new break days.. While the gesture is appreciated, these no-class days dramatically fail to compensate students for the lack of spring break. We get a seemingly random Thursday and Wednesday off in the semester as opposed to the typical week off. While the week of spring break would be a time of genuine relaxation, these two days off are sandwiched between class days, giving students no actual time off due to the assignments they will have to complete for the next day.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand why Furman made this decision. One of the biggest risks to campus safety is student travel, which could bring COVID cases back to campus from outside hotspots. However, that does not mean spring break had to be completely cancelled. Spring break comes at a crucial part in the semester, providing students a much needed respite after midterm exams. In their zeal to shield the student body from the virus, the university has completely neglected this fact. While students going off campus for spring break would likely cause problems, perhaps an on-campus alternative could have been arranged to still give us a break from classes while keeping us safe. For example, the University could rebrand spring break to “Wellness Week” or something similar and provide safe, COVID-friendly activities on campus for students to participate in to de-stress, such as outdoor movies, intramural sports, or outdoor arts and crafts events.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, the schedule for our spring semester has been set in stone, so any changes are practically impossible. However, going forward, the administration should make sure they accept some student feedback on these issues if, God forbid, we are still facing the same problems during the Fall 2021 semester or any other point in the future. Something as simple as a virtual town hall or student survey looking for suggestions would be a great way to ensure academic and mental health crises are mitigated in the future.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdac1",name:"Engaged Living: A Welcome Source of Community During the Pandemic",slug:"engaged-living-a-welcome-source-of-community-during-the-pandemic",timestamps:{published_at:"2021-01-28T07:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df78fd59fe1d47b062160d",name:"Bella Dickenson",slug:"bella-dickenson",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fbella-dickenson_2021-03-21.jpg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"The Engaged Living program provided me with a sense of community that I am very grateful for.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F6012d552aaf0356448046134_EG.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"There are still opportunities to find community, despite the limits of this school year.",photo_credit:"Furman News",body:"\u003Cp\u003EI was told that the first few weeks of college would be some of the hardest. Being in an unfamiliar place around unfamiliar people naturally inspires feelings of trepidation, and there is a real pressure to form close relationships as quickly as possible. For students arriving in the fall of 2020, these worries were multiplied tenfold. Gone were the usual opportunities in events, clubs, and groups to take part in social interaction. The quintessential college experience was put on hold. Parties became relics of a lost age; spaces once bustling with activity became muted reflections of themselves. Classes were either heavily socially distanced or held on Zoom, so the ability to have meaningful conversations with professors and peers was severely hindered. Humans are social animals — college students perhaps most of all — so the restrictions hit hard. Of course, it bears mentioning that it is because of these safety restrictions that we are able to be on campus at all. Even though the college experience is not the same as it once was, I am thankful to be here at Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there have been moments in my time here at Furman where glimpses of the true college experience have shone through. Perhaps for you it is a sport you play or a club you participate in. For me, it has been the Engaged Living community I joined last semester. Last summer I received an email explaining just what Engaged Living was: a group of freshmen who live together and take a class together and do various activities together. Sounds neat! The one I was interested in was a philosophy and political science community that analyses the works of Plato and Aristotle and applies them to politics throughout history. As a philosophy nerd, this was right up my alley. Alumni from the program emphasized the deep conversations they had with each other and with their professors. And, on top of all of that, members get to live in Clark Murphy as freshmen. The only thing I had to do was write a short essay to apply. Needless to say, I was sold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReading Aristotle, having nice dorms, all of these things were great, but there were benefits beneath the surface that ultimately proved more valuable. Our hall, through mere propinquity and through taking the same class, quickly formed the kinds of relationships I thought I would miss out on due to the pandemic. We played games to get to know each other, we went hiking, we watched movies, we read together, and we offered encouragement to one another. Once a week or so, we met with our “Symposiarchs,” seniors who were also once members of the program. These meetings were a welcome way to interact with older, more experienced students in a way that we might otherwise not have been able to. We got to hear advice for our classes and other valuable words of wisdom from students who had had similar experiences to our own.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough all of these experiences, there were moments when I knew that this was what the college life was \u003Cem\u003Esupposed\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to feel like, learning amongst friends and laughing together. Was it perfect? Of course not. We still lived in a pandemic during a tumultuous election, after all. But those glimpses were still present. The Engaged Living program provided me with a sense of community during my first semester that I am very grateful for. Last semester was bizarre, to say the least, and I doubt that the spring will be very different. Yet, there are still opportunities to find community, despite the limits of this school year. Form bonds with the people you have on your halls, the people you play sports with, or the people you have in your clubs. Make memories together you will look back on fondly.

You are expected to look and act your best for hours on end in hopes of being selected by a sorority. As if being scored isn’t stressful enough, you are simultaneously expected to pick the sisterhood that is perfect for you in a matter of days. For some Potential New Members (PNMs), the process is perceived as so awful and superficial they completely drop out without finding their home. In fact, my freshman year recruitment was so overwhelming I dropped only halfway through even though I desperately wanted the sense of community sororities provide. Luckily, I received a bid a few weeks after recruitment and ended up where I needed to be. However, after my subpar in-person experience I was nervous that recruitment would be even more unfair and tiring over a computer screen.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main concern was the lack of warmth Zoom would provide. Immersing yourself in the social environment of each sorority is a significant part of the recruitment process that cannot be replaced by muffled music and shared Zoom screens. Another concern I had was implicit biases sorority women may have when ranking the PNMs without face-to-face interactions. While there are girls who inherently have an advantage because of who they know, prior to this year everyone was still walking into the same room and having face-to-face interactions. Now, PNMs would be scored in different time zones and through tiny screens. I was also worried about both PNMs and sorority women who didn't have access to stable internet or nice cameras and laptops. While I would like to think those things wouldn’t matter, it’s easier to remember positive things about a 10-minute conversation with pristine lighting and audio than it is with a glitchy mic or dull background.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile my concerns were not completely resolved, Zoom recruitment brought one pleasant surprise: a level of authenticity I had not yet seen in Greek Life. The COVID restrictions last semester made it hard for sororities to get to know the freshmen since pop-ins were virtual and interactions were limited. This created a fresh start for many PNMs going through recruitment, as the process this year required new interactions and placed less of an emphasis on who you knew beforehand. Supportive, uplifting, and hopeful conversations supplanted the usual surface-level checklists. RecruitmentIt being over Zoom ultimately allowed PNMs to make a decision based on where they truly felt at home, even over a screen. PNMs were able to determine who they felt connected to without the peer pressure and bells and whistles usually present during rounds.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though recruitment lacked the in-person interaction most Furman students are craving, it created a place where the new members were more in control of the experience and allowed PNMs to make more of an unbiased decision on to which sorority they wanted to join. Genuine and deep conversations during recruitment usually don’t occur until later in the week. Myself and many other sorority women were worried that Zoom would only amplify the challenge of getting to truly know the PNMs but it ended up being the complete opposite. Creating an environment that solely focused on the conversation you were having with no distractions allowed the sororities to get to know every PNM on a much deeper level much earlier on. Zoom recruitment still had its flaws, and once things are safe again it should continue to be held in person. But the beautiful authenticity in conversations we experienced over Zoom should be reflected on and replicated throughout future recruitments. It would benefit both the sororities and PNMs and be a huge step towards making recruitment a more positive experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdaac",name:"Public Relations or Public Health?

The ability to adapt to changing circumstances and challenging situations is especially critical in times of crisis. Fortunately, Furman’s response to COVID-19 has been both flexible and successful. After initially planning to test only symptomatic students and close contacts, the administration pivoted, and the robust testing regime that followed is a major reason cases remained low on campus in the fall, despite less-than-ideal student behavior. But while the university’s pandemic response has been both adaptive and effective, it has lacked transparency. That needs to change.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast week, a Furman Focused email announced that the university had “developed a color-coded system to describe the university’s operational protocols.” We are currently in the Orange phase, with the possibility of moving to Yellow after Jan. 25. At first glance, this new system is a step forward, providing a mental image that reflects Furman’s already-flexible approach to COVID-19. But the array of colors masks a dearth of substance. The color-coded scheme does indeed “describe the university’s operational protocols,” in the sense that it lays out five different potential policy scenarios. But beyond vague assurances that the administrators are looking at “disease rates and quarantine\u002Ftreatment capacities on campus and in the community,” we are not told how this model would actually guide decision-making. Students, faculty, and the broader community deserve to know: does the administration have a clearly-defined plan?

Knowing what benchmarks the university is using to make decisions will help students be better prepared and more understanding of the needs of the community. More importantly, transparency paves the way for genuine accountability. Without transparency, we cannot tell whether the administration is prioritizing public health or public relations — integrity is an unknown. Releasing the details of the protocols to the public would not only aid the campus community in our efforts to keep COVID-19 at bay; it would also strengthen our trust in the administrators tasked with making difficult, institutional-level decisions about those efforts. We ought to be able to judge our university’s performance by its own standards.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo much transparency can be a problem: privacy and internal deliberation are necessary for the proper functioning of any individual or institution. When every decision or action is public-facing, people are incentivized to fabricate lies or half-truths in order to hide, ironically obscuring truth and hindering accountability to an even greater degree. But that is not the case in our situation, today. The university has considerable leeway in constructing its COVID-19 response, because students, faculty, and their families trust that the internal deliberation will lead to policy decisions that are intended to protect campus health. That trust, however, is not a guarantee. Honesty and openness on behalf of the administrators could only strengthen it.

When looking for colleges, I did not narrow my search geographically. Instead, I looked all over the country and ultimately decided on Furman simply because it was a school I loved.

Yet I soon learned that, in this context, \u003Cem\u003EYankee\u003C\u002Fem\u003E was used to describe anyone from above the Mason Dixon line. It was coined to describe a set stereotype, attributable to anyone from an expansive geographic region that is entirely not one note.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn actuality I am hardly a \u003Cem\u003EYankee\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (in the Southern sense of the word). I moved around the country and the world growing up and only lived in the north for several years. Yet my short residency in Massachusetts automatically qualified me, in my peers eyes, as the same as every single Northeasterner. Now, I have accepted the label as a sort of badge of pride, a nod at the more likeable aspects of where I am from, However my peer’s quickness to generalize me simply based on a single fact was illuminating—I was judged based on a location I hardly shared deep associations with. In the same way that candidates are often expected to defaultly sweep one region, I was assumed to be the same as all of those who hailed from my state, or even the seven states that make-up the northeast. However, just as the 2020 election proved the above-mentioned political assumption to be untrue, my geographic dissociation with the term \u003Cem\u003EYankee\u003C\u002Fem\u003E highlights the falisty in this societal labeling.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ease and familiarity with which people refrence the Civil War, slavery and Reconstriction is also opposed to the rhetoric used in the north.

You swipe left and right based on a cursory glance, but when you finally match with someone, you still do not know who they really are. Obviously Greek life is not a lifelong experience, but it is a long-term experience – one that should not be entirely determined by virtual events. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany freshmen are depending on rush and Greek life to give them a taste of the college experience that this fall semester has largely been devoid of. While normal rush week is somewhat compromised, the inclusion of one, if not a few in-person events would be much more effective in providing this snapshot than an entirely online process. This past semester has been one characterized by abnormality—it does not seem unfair to ask the Panhellenic committee to allow one concession in hopes of receiving a remnant of what appears almost completely lost. Furthermore, students have shown throughout this semester that they can be smart, keeping themselves and others safe; it is not a far-out idea that rush participants can do the same. &nbsp; \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman should reconsider holding at least bid day in person, an opportunity both potential and current members would be excited about. A challenge of this pandemic has been learning to weigh the consequences of events. .

Now that it is all online, the process is even more terrifying.",photo_credit:"Furman University",body:"\u003Cp\u003EThis fall has been uncomfortably different, and I have little hope that the spring will bring a return to “normalcy.” Student organizations at Furman seem to share my conclusion, and consequently have accepted the permanence of our current situation with a begrudging, but all the same willing, attitude. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps hardest hit amongst these student organizations is Greek Life, as functions, events and get-togethers have all but been eradicated. Though all these casualties are generally regrettable, there is one aspect of Greek Life that will suffer most from our new COVID-19 regulations: rush. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorority members will readily confess that rush was the most “exhausting” week of their lives. Yet the word exhausting is an understatement. &nbsp;The truth is, rush is mentally taxing, physically draining and socially unpleasant. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast year, I spent three days parading around campus like a tribute amongst her competitors in the Hunger Games. The different rounds were our trials, and in the end, the Capitol judges, aka the sororities, assigned us our tribute scores and determined our homes for the next three years. To lessen the potency of this dystopian picture, I will concede this—I love where I ended up, and I know multiple people have had similar experiences. Yet I also know, having completed the process, that my placement was hardly an accident. In many ways, rush is pre-determined. In retrospect, I think it was this fact that made the three days so grueling. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERumors have always circulated that it was who you know, rather than who you are, that determines your sorority. I rejected this idea as a freshman, not because I thought that it was unfounded, but because I wanted to give the process the benefit of the doubt. I went into each round thinking that conversations made a difference. I was wrong. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversations during rounds are largely just confirmation that whatever X sorority member said about you earlier was valid. Sure, there are exceptions, but considering most of my class got placed in sororities with either a) a majority of their friend group, b) where they knew many upperclassmen, or c) they had some previous connection, I think pre-determination has a place in the sorority manifesto. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I will make another concession: on some levels, this sort of placement process is unavoidable. It is simply impossible to get to know somebody in a 30-minute conversation, and therefore context and references are helpful. But if sororities are going to set up the system in this way, freshman should be aware. They should know the importance of pre-rush interaction, and not proceed like I did—oblivious, naïve and much too hopeful. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis year, typical rush has been replaced by a new, online, format. Unfortunately, I fear no positive benefit can come from this type of change—in fact, I think this shift will only exaggerate the unfairness of the current system. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs rush adopts Zoom formatting, the slim chance one had of making a lasting impression in regular rounds grows even more minute. Freshman will almost \u003Cem\u003Ehave to \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ehave some sort of previous “in” to influence their fate. Likely, sororities are going to &nbsp;rely more heavily on their members’ earlier interactions with potential new members to make decisions—interactions that have taken place during a socially distanced and awkward fall. As a result, references are likely going to be inaccurate or single-sourced and, as a result, unsubstantiated conclusions could be drawn. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I would like to say that this chaos could lead to some beneficial re-structing of the rush system, my intuition says sororities will resort to “he says she says” citations, outward appearances and social media stalking to determine their next members. While this is sad for the PNMs, it is also sad for the sororities. But this sort of regression is distastefully stereotypical of Furman’s Greek Life. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am unsure of how January’s events will proceed, but I feel deeply for the participants. While Greek Life at Furman is by no means a perfect institution, I have found the sisterhood aspect of it welcoming. It is simply unfortunate that initiation into these organizations first requires hurdling a broken, and frankly socially uncouth, rush. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdba1",name:"In the Wake of the Presidential Election, We Have Much to Learn from Each Other",slug:"in-the-wake-of-the-presidential-election-we-have-much-to-learn-from-each-other",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-11-13T00:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc53",name:"Jonathan McKinney",slug:"jonathan-mckinney",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"We should not be so quick to disregard Joe Biden’s call for unity.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5faec2d4e86ac0890a8fc281_content%2520(2).jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"This election cycle has been defined by intense polarization and combative politics.

Are they friendly critics, whose views help fill in our own blind spots? Or do we perhaps engage with our adversaries because they challenge us to sharpen our own arguments? Whatever the rationale, we are told from a young age that democracy works best when all perspectives are at the table – that we become, somehow, \u003Cem\u003Ebetter when\u003C\u002Fem\u003E we engage with our political enemies. Why? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2020, espousing this view is often seen as out-of-touch or quaint. Politics may never have been very collaborative, but today we are told the things at stake are matters of life and death, of human rights and moral wrongs and therefore they cannot even be up for debate. Such high stakes are often used as a tool to shut down discussion. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading up to the election, I noticed several social media accounts – including some run by Furman students – posting messages to the effect that if you did not agree with some absolute moral standard, or if you planned to vote for a particular candidate, you should unfollow the account. Prevalent as this sentiment is, it is hardly a surprise that an informal poll of conservative students at Furman revealed that two in three would be unwilling to publicly declare who they voted for. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the election, many seem to retain their hostile stance towards their political enemies. President-elect Joe Biden’s calls for unity and claims that he plans to be a “President for all Americans” (even those who did not vote for him), tend to fall on deaf ears. Most people I have talked to tend to assume that Biden’s rhetoric is just that – rhetoric – and that it will not amount to much. That may be true, but for me, the rhetoric itself is enough. America has spent too long and suffered too deeply in the grip of tribalism and hyper-partisanship to be angry at the president-elect, the first politician in years to try setting a new tone for the country. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings us back to the question: why spend time listening to your opponents? There is no doubt that Biden’s bipartisan rhetoric feels good, but is he right? Or is it rather a betrayal when we entertain the notion that our core moral convictions could be wrong? \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have spent a long time over the past few weeks wrestling with this question. It is a puzzle with many pieces to it, but for me, the most compelling reason is simply that at the end of the day we are stuck with each other. Staying in your echo chamber is possible – increasingly so, with social media – but it is not enriching. I have heard many Furman students and faculty say that talking to someone living five minutes from campus (who may very well have voted differently than you) may be a more enlightening experience than a study away in Europe. If we want to live fulfilling lives, we must learn to live with each other, not just next to each other. That starts with understanding each other’s point of view. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding is a matter of listening. You do not have to like what you hear; you do not even have to be open to persuasion. But we stand to learn much by considering the values, rationales and priorities of those who do not think like us on political issues. Even if you find your opponents’ views completely reprehensible, you still cannot attempt to convince someone of another persuasion to consider your viewpoint without first understanding their position. With the removal of a polarizing president (say what you will about him) and the election of a “President for all Americans,” we have a unique opportunity to learn this lesson: to start over with, at the very least, a willingness to listen and understand. It is frustrating to see so many passing it up. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb8f",name:"We Need to Approach Diversity and Inclusion Differently",slug:"we-need-to-approach-diversity-and-inclusion-differently",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc4a",name:"Evan Myers (Provisional)",slug:"evan-myers",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets-global.website-files.com\u002F5f37fcdc1b6edd6760ad912f\u002F5f4814aa2c3763ecb38ec309_5f418ff6e903f235ac41e277_EVS.jpeg"}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"True diversity and inclusion cannot be achieved through compulsion; it only occurs in community.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5fabec480f771fe9db5e97d7_iStock-1192309925-divided-capitol-cropped.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"The Student Leadership Campus Diversity Initiative should include promoting and protecting political diversity as a top priority.",photo_credit:"iStock",body:"\u003Cp\u003EWhile the drama of the national election attracted everyone’s attention last week, some Furman students were attempting to win votes (more specifically, signatures) for a cause that could have a much greater and more immediate impact on our community: \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fform.jotform.com\u002F202789286639170\"\u003Ethe Student Leadership Campus Diversity Initiative\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initiative, which was written by diverse student leaders at Furman, offers three central policy recommendations:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere should be a diversity GER credit requirement.

As someone who cares deeply about diversity and inclusion, I concur with the criticism that many Furman students fail to recognize its importance. To point that problem out, think of solutions and marshal support behind them is a needed and worthwhile pursuit. Furman students should confront questions of diversity and inclusion in their four years at the university. Furman students should be pushed beyond their comfort zone by people who may not look, act or think like them. Again, these are admirable objectives.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I fear that even if these policy recommendations were instituted, these measures would have little effect. What’s more, it seems possible to me that this initiative could actually be counterproductive to the broader goal of getting all Furman students to care about diversity and inclusion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain. Though it should not be, diversity and inclusion is often intimidating to white students. For example, I attended a CLP my sophomore year where I was the only white person in a room full of students of color. For some reason, I felt odd and out of place. I wanted to leave. In hindsight, however, I am glad I stayed, because over the next hour I finally began to understand how many students of color told me they felt in classrooms where they were the only black or brown student.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite my positive experience, my point stands. Diversity and inclusion is intimidating to many white students, and as a result, they tend not to engage with our diverse communities on campus. Though this reality&nbsp; is a shame, the solution cannot simply be to require uninterested students to disingenuously attend events and take classes. In fact, when forced, diversity and inclusion seems to alienate and divide rather than unite. The sort of caring and inclusive community that we are seeking cannot be conceived from compulsion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind, the main reason that so many white students are intimidated by diversity and inclusion is because they do not feel that they have a seat at the table. Though not always, conversations about diversity and inclusion are often perceived as attempts at education, efforts to make ignorant white students aware of their own privilege and inherent racism. That perception does not necessarily reflect reality, but instituting the changes that this initiative calls for will serve to reinforce that notion in some students’ minds.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, when the Student Leadership Campus Diversity Initiative petition calls for raising awareness about “issues affecting students of varying race, sexual orientation, religion, and nationality,” everyone knows that it is not talking about issues affecting white, heterosexual, Christian, Americans (which is a rather large demographic at Furman) – and that is okay. White, heterosexual, Christian, American students do not face many of the challenges that their diverse peers face. The problem is not that diversity and inclusion does not focus enough on white students, but rather that it often casts those students in the role of the oppressor. To the extent that it does so, it tends to make many students feel like vestiges of a racist past rather than active elements in a conversation about diversity and inclusion moving forward.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, some might suggest that the diversity and inclusion initiative needs to be shot down. I disagree. In fact, I think it needs to expand its scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore specifically, I think that the petition should include political diversity as a top priority. Conversations across the ideological aisle are essential to any diverse community. Furman, and our country, currently struggle to have such conversations.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier this fall, for example, I asked College Democrats and the Furman Conservative Society to write side-by-side columns for \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E on key policy issues as we approached the presidential election this November. After several attempts, the two sides could simply not come together after College Democrats refused to “debate human rights.” That language is designed to shut down dialogue and demonize the other side. Unfortunately, it is resoundingly similar to statements about how “everyone who votes for Trump is a racist and any person of color who votes for Trump has internalized racism” that I frequently see leaders advocating for diversity and inclusion at Furman post in public forums online.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat rhetoric is counterproductive to our mission to become a more diverse and inclusive place. It alienates the roughly \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thepaladin.news\u002Farticles\u002Fhow-a-halloween-pub-crawl-should-remind-us-to-think-differently-about-freedom\"\u003E30% of the student body that voted for Trump\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. It also justifies those students’ hesitancy to engage in dialogue about how to make Furman better. It makes them feel singled out and uniquely evil.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncluding political diversity in this new initiative would go a long way towards dismissing the fears of those students who find themselves in the political minority on campus. Moreover, it would show them that they can claim an active role in helping Furman become a more diverse and inclusive institution. Rather than being preached to, they can join the conversation. That seems like a much more efficient way to get students interested in diversity and inclusion than requiring them to take certain classes or attend certain CLPs.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, Furman finds itself at an interesting position on its mission to become a more diverse and inclusive community. Increasingly, it seems we have students, clubs and groups who are promoting diversity and attempting to have a conversation about how to change campus for the better. At the same time, many students are still not engaged in meaningful dialogue about these issues.&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is easy to blame those unengaged students, but the reality is that the way we have conversations about diversity and inclusion often alienates people with certain political perspectives and discourages them from participating. Consequently, forcing them to participate will not improve the situation unless we also change the way we understand and discuss diversity and inclusion. Including political diversity as a priority for this new initiative would be an important step in the right direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"}],totalDocs:577,limit:25,page:4,totalPages:24,nextPage:5,prevPage:3,hasPrevPage:true,hasNextPage:true},pageTitle:"Opinions"},uses:{params:["category","page"],url:1}}],
