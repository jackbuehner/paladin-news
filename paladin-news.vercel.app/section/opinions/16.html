Mohammad Abu-Salha, father of the deceased sisters, affirms that the murder was a hate crime. Hicks targeted the victims because of their religion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMr. Hicks has been immediately charged with three counts of first degree murder. According to FindLaw.com, a first degree murder is one that involves willfulness, premeditation and deliberation. A hate crime is often triggered by bias of race, sexuality, religion, and other differentiating factors. Murder and hate crime may not always be mutually exclusive and in this particular case there needs to be an in depth investigation and follow up of the killer’s motivation, as opposed to blindly accepting the event as a tragedy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis murder raises questions ranging from gun control to Islamophobia in America, yet there has not been enough media attention and public discourse about it. Even though Mr. Hicks’ social media posts indicate his rather extreme atheist ideals, public and media opinions are leaning toward the apologetic narrative of Hicks and his wife, which is that he simply acted out of anger.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother neighbor reportedly said that Mr. Hicks’ aggression was toward all his neighbors; why then did he choose to kill his Muslim neighbors and their visiting sister on a day where his parking space stayed vacant?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis incident made me wonder how exasperated the media outrage would have been had they been a Christian family, and how America would have reacted if Mr. Hicks had been a Muslim man.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is an undisputable double standard in the media’s depiction of events.

The president of the United States used a selfie stick, made funny faces in the mirror, and just goofed off like anyone would. He then promoted the deadline to sign up for health insurance (it was Feb. 15, in case you forgot).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the video is entertaining, it is also a thinly veiled marketing push to millennials. While it can be kind of disconcerting to know that the video is just a marketing scheme to get youth to sign up for healthcare and some people are going so far as to call it a new form of propaganda, I personally do not think that is the case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact is the youth vote was what gave Mr. Obama the presidency in 2008 and 2012. According to the Pew Research Center, Obama got 66 percent of the youth vote in 2008 and 67 percent in 2012. Despite such strong numbers during presidential election years, voter apathy is high, especially among those aged 18 to 24. The 2014 Congressional midterms saw the lowest voter turnout since the 1940’s. The group with the lowest numbers in that election cycle was the millennial population. Most students here on campus did not even know when the 2015 State of the Union was, much less took an hour out of their overloaded schedules to watch it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur generation cares about politics but we care about it only when it seems like the stakes are too high to risk being left out. We care about it when it is most convenient for us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also care about convenience and intimacy in the media we consume. According to some studies, YouTube stars that share their personal stories and open up space for conversations with their audiences are more popular among American teens than distant silver screen celebrities. Younger viewers are tuning out of CNN’s nightly broadcast and tuning in to Twitter and YouTube to get news, for better or for worse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy wouldn’t President Obama connect with his most influential constituency by using the media we consume the most?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Buzzfeed video also does not represent the first time the president has gone the untraditional route to spread his message. Remember “Between Two Ferns” in 2014? Besides, who could forget the debacle that traditional news outlets raised when three prominent YouTubers got to interview the President in person after the 2015 State of The Union.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Presidential Buzzfeed video represents an interesting transformation in the media scene, not White House propaganda. President Obama already uses government agencies to spread information, however, it is nowhere near as popular as private sector methods like Buzzfeed or the Post-State of The Union Google partnership. The Buzzfeed video featuring President Obama received over 30 million views in just two days. A typical weekly update video on The White House YouTube channel averages 20 to 30 thousand views.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA problematic media environment arises when the White House intentionally crushes other narratives to spread news. In 2013 the White House Correspondents’ Association and 37 other organizations submitted a letter to the White House press secretary to highlight the fact that the involved media organizations felt intentionally bypassed by government-associated press from documenting White House events. That is the closest the Obama administration has come to propaganda, not the Buzzfeed video.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything the Buzzfeed video is Obama’s “fireside chat” in the style of FDR. The video is an attempt to gain millennials’ attention about the state of the United States and our place in this country even as we are becoming more and more disengaged from traditional media. Yes, it is a silly video and yes Obama’s involvement with YouTube stars is pissing off traditional media behemoths. But that does not mean it is propaganda. It represents an attempt by the government to meet millennials, the future of the United States, where we stand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82d63",name:"Grade Inflation at Furman: Are We Really Doing Ourselves a Favor?",slug:"grade-inflation-at-furman-are-we-really-doing-ourselves-a-favor",timestamps:{published_at:"2015-02-20T05:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97744bc989e23628edbfd",name:"Jai-Ryung (Jenny) Lee",slug:"jai-ryung-jenny-lee",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["issue11"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003ERecently there has been increased discussion about grade inflation. Especially with Furman’s own computer science professor, Dr. Chris Healy co-authoring a study and Furman being one of the schools that GradeInflation.com studies, it is obvious that the grade inflation phenomenon is one that we cannot avoid.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gist of the study’s result is this: students are getting higher grades for the same quality work. As Stuart Rojstaczer said in his interview with The Atlantic, “Students aren’t getting any smarter. They aren’t studying more. When they graduate they are less literate. There’s no indication that the increase of grades nationwide is related to any increase in performance or achievement.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we throw our hands up either in celebration (or indignation because of our disagreement with how difficult it is to maintain an optimal GPA here), a debate of why a university exists and what students should be getting out of their college education is necessary. While that conversation should be saved for later, we can start by examining where Furman stands. Furman’s mission statement states: “In accordance with the traditional assumptions of liberal education, both out-of-class and in-class experiences are designed to develop the whole person—intellectually, physically, socially, emotionally, and spiritually. Furman seeks highly motivated students with inquisitive minds, varied perspectives, a sense of personal integrity and moral responsibility with the potential to be leaders and to make future contributions to society.” Note that there is no mention of GPA or specific post-graduation employment quotas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany students choose to attend liberal arts colleges for a variety of reasons, but the liberal arts curriculum was designed to provide students with a holistic education, a safe zone for students to explore, perhaps for the last time, various fields and studies on a deeper level. It allows students who matriculate with “Undecided” written on their applications to immerse themselves into different fields and decide where the infamous “What-You-Are-Good-At” and “What-You-Enjoy-Doing” Venn diagram they fit into.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntro-level classes are a prime example of this Venn diagram. They should be taught in a way that allows students to figure out whether they are passionate in the subject, but the components that comprise the final grade should be designed in such a way that the final grade reflects the expert professor’s evaluation of the students work. This evaluation can indicate how practical—both passion- and talent-wise—it is for that student to continue in that field. Hence the reason why liberal arts colleges frown upon teaching assistants, rather than the actual professors, teaching and interacting with the class—professors, especially those with doctorate degrees, are experts in the field and know better than anyone else what it takes to succeed in their field.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the biggest issue comes in when students are moving between departments and trying to figure out what they want to major in. Because there will inevitably be a disconnect in intensity-level between departments, whether that be large or small, students can easily consider that they are more equipped to enter one field than another judging from the grades they receive while taking courses from both fields. If the grades given across the campus are not reflecting the ability of the students and the quality of the work that they are producing, students are not receiving the proper feedback from the professors that they need and deserve to figure out which field they are not only most passionate in, but also talented and skilled in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven, it is very difficult to successfully compare the value of GPAs in 1951 and 2015. GPAs are absolutely critical to the outside world and a high GPA is necessary for Furman students to get accepted into graduate schools, consider study away possibilities, or seek out internships. When so many other colleges are inflating their GPAs, it would be foolish of Furman to standardize its GPA and put its more-qualified students at a disadvantage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps what is needed is not a deflation of grades but a better communication system between professors and students for professors to effectively communicate the students’ strengths and weaknesses and honestly convey their evaluation of the student’s work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman’s tuition for the academic year of 2014-2015 was over $40,000. What makes a Furman education worth this sum? I would like to believe that it is not merely a couple letters that are given to me at the end of a semester but a more holistic evaluation and advice about the work I produce. Ultimately, a perfect 4.0 does not translate into a perfect 10 in the infamous post-Furman “real world.” Let’s face it, constantly seeking a perfect 4.0 may not be serving our own best interests.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82d62",name:"The Oscars: Who Should Win?",slug:"the-oscars-who-should-win-2",timestamps:{published_at:"2015-02-20T05:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628edb40",name:"Scott Harvey",slug:"scott-harvey",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["issue11"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003EAh, the Oscars: the only time besides the Democratic National Convention when you can see all of Hollywood’s biggest stars gathered in one location.

Stone’s performance a superb display by an actress whose future simply couldn’t be more promising.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample Quote: “Who are you? You hate bloggers.

Simmons is long overdue for an Oscar and anyone who saw Whiplash would find it hard to disagree that his performance is worthy of one. As Miles Teller’s ferocious, dictatorial, and borderline sadistic drum instructor, Simmons will make you forget that he ever played Juno’s dad. His performance could have easily been a caricature, but Simmons is too experienced of an actor to make his character one-dimensional. It is a truly unforgettable performance in a year full of them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample Quote: “There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ‘good job.’”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBest Adapted Screenplay: Damien Chazelle, “Whiplash.” \u003C\u002Fb\u003EThe best adapted screenplay of the year, Gillian Flynn’s for Gone Girl, was not even nominated, but Chazelle’s is nearly equal to it. Fierce, angry, and unbearably intense, “Whiplash” was a stunning independent effort from a writer-director with a bright future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBest Original Screenplay: Richard Linklater, “Boyhood.”\u003C\u002Fb\u003E I was thrilled to see “Nightcrawler” nominated in this category, but there was no better screenplay this year than Linklater’s. It is one of the wisest and most profound pieces of storytelling you are ever likely to see. It is a thing of effortless brilliance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBest Actress: Reese Witherspoon, “Wild.”\u003C\u002Fb\u003E Reese Witherspoon is a brilliant actress (see: “Election,” “Pleasantville,” her Oscar-winning turn in “Walk the Line”) but she has strayed off the path recently, which is why her no-holds-barred performance in “Wild” was so refreshing to see. As the only person on screen for large sections of the movie, Witherspoon’s task is a daunting one but it is one she more than rises to meet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample Quote: “My mother used to say something that drove me nuts.

Keaton’s career-defining turn in “Birdman” was the best piece of acting that 2014 had to offer. It’s clear that his performance is an extremely personal one and it is on display in every frame of “Birdman.” “Birdman” was undoubtedly the most visually stunning movie of the year, but it’s a testament to Keaton that he was the thing you could not take your eyes off.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample Quote: “Give the people what they want!

Another set of classes, breaks, and meals ensues and before the last class ends around 2:20 p.m., students go to labs or internships. For many students a meeting before dinner, a quick bite at the DH, then a meeting for another organization rounds out the day. Of course, the executive team has to meet for another hour after the large group meeting. By the time the average Furman student arrives in his or her study place to start on homework, the clock has already hit 9 p.m.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is going to be a long night.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFew people outside of the South know about Furman so when I share about our school, I am met with remarks about our “achievement culture” with alarming frequency. While this phrase signifies something different to every student, to me, Furman’s “achievement culture” is manifested in a robust Greek system, a high percentage of student participation in extracurricular activities, and, most importantly, a high average number of organizations in which each student participates. In general, being “involved” at Furman is normal and expected. While this proves that our student body is motivated and active, the problem with our achievement culture is that it can be divisive. We become internally and externally isolated; students “burn-out,” and the culture homogenizes our already woefully non-diverse student body.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy bias towards the achievement culture stems from my first two years at Furman where I joined eight student organizations, including a fraternity. My sophomore year schedule was a ridiculous mish-mash of frantic notes-to-self in between meetings, a colorful array of post-it to-do lists—none more than half-completed—and the occasional demarcated reminder of an upcoming test or project. One might say that my story is the extreme: an example of over-involvement at a school where most students strike a healthy work\u002Flife balance. However, if you found yourself nodding or relating to the schedule of the typical Furman student in the opening, whether for yourself or your overly-involved friends around you, substantive and anecdotal evidence supports the over-involvement narrative; it starts before the freshmen arrive on campus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we should recognize the positives of involvement. Organizations give autonomy to a handful of democratically-elected students and provide funding from SGA to do cool things. Two organizations I joined, TEDxFurmanU and the Furman Creative Collaborative, endeavored to do just that. Gaining experience leading your peers is advantageous. Its utility in job interviews after graduation, however, is overstated. Inevitably, organizations must compete with each other to attract new members. This emerges most clearly in the chaos of the Involvement Fair in the first week of fall semester. Organizations compete for new members by touting their credentials: “Last year we planned eight CLPs, won this award, and brought that speaker.” Why? Because at Furman, the blind trust of the CLP system establishes the most tangible metric for success: whether the event was CLP certified—or not. CLP events may enhance, to an immeasurable degree, our cultural intelligence. The involvement culture is also great in the interconnectedness it brings to our already small student body. A handful of big events every year—Heller’s Fall Fest in October and Homecoming are two examples—unify much of our student body.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs great as it may look on the surface, however, we cannot minimize the unintended consequences of our achievement culture. The first consequence is not unfamiliar to many: burn-out. The high-achiever’s schedule is unsustainable. It should not be envied. The “stars” among us may strike a more appropriate balance than I did, but regardless, after two short years and hundreds of hours invested into my organizations, I burned out. I left sophomore year with nothing in the tank, strongly influencing my decision to spend my entire junior year away from Furman. Many students view “burn-out” as a stage in their busy livelihoods—just another part of the cycle of the life of a motivated college student. What is important to remember is that we as individuals are affected by each and every stage we choose to place on our cycle of life. The arrows may direct us from one part of the cycle to another but the intensity and the direction of the cycle as whole is also something we must keep in mind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother consequence of Furman’s achievement culture is that it divides us. The division is attributable in part to the Greek system; natural rivalries sprout as a result of social grouping into organizations whose success is predicated on maintaining a “desirable” image. The division is also the fault of a culture, and society at large, where we covet immediate, achievable, and tangible rewards. In this reward-driven culture we set our sights on a certain goal—e.g. President of the sorority, Quaternion, or a Furman Fellow—and work to realize it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final consequence of over-involvement is the most serious: the creation of “the Furman bubble.” We are an insular community by every metric. Our geographic and socioeconomic isolation helps construct an invisible barrier that allows for uninhibited growth of our achievement culture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are no Bob Jones, but the “bubble” keeps us on campus, occupied during the week with our academic and extracurricular commitments and on the weekends with Greek functions and the occasional attempt to “pop the bubble.” The bubble’s persistence is a serious handicap to cultural enrichment at Furman. Heller, Greek philanthropy events, and a handful of extracurricular service projects and organizations constitute our attempts to start a university service culture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApprenticeships, volunteer opportunities, and summer internships are our efforts to start an internship culture, but the truth is, we are not a service culture at Furman. Our culture is not recognized for volunteerism, internships, or studying away. We have an achievement culture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging a culture is complex and difficult and it requires buy-in from students, staff, faculty, and administration. First, we must value different metrics for success, support creativity and personal expression, and encourage connection to our community, city, and region. Greenville is a special place.

Everything from shallow dating apps and unrealistic movie stars to clothing advertisements and beauty magazines are the sole antagonists in the highly prevalent issue of A bad body image in this country.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have all heard this conversation before, and we have all been taught who the “bad guys” are. Media, celebrity culture, and even certain social institutions such as gym culture and Greek life have all been highly scrutinized for their role in distorting the standard of both male and female bodies. While some of this scrutiny is justified, it is important to recognize that the problem of unrealistic body image cannot be traced back to one media outlet or one social institution, and is perhaps more insidious than people care to believe.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I explain what I mean by this, it is important for me to share some of my own experiences with body image. As an individual who has previously been labeled everything from “chubby” and “fat” to “curvy” and “healthy,” I have felt the whole spectrum between complete confidence and crippling insecurity. I have vied to have the perfect body of the beautiful cover models in fashion magazines, and been terrified to go to lift weights at many gyms in fear of being judged. However, I have also felt a wonderful sense of acceptance from the Furman community, which has allowed me to foster my own self-acceptance and gain confidence in who I truly am. This self-acceptance is often lost when I go back home and am forced to face parents, relatives, and old friends, who are quick to judge how my body has changed over the semester or year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile my story is not a particularly unique one, there are certainly others who have had vastly different experiences with body image, both on and off Furman’s campus. By sharing my own experience, I do not mean to say that everyone shares the same perspective that I do, but rather quite the opposite: each person finds sources of body insecurity and body confidence from a diverse range of people and things. These sources could come from parents, friends, media outlets, social groups, and even strangers. It is even possible that one source could instill unrealistic body expectations in one person, while simultaneously empowering another. An example of this could be the gym, which may leave one person empowered by their body’s capabilities, and leave another individual insecure in the fact that their body does not look like the ripped men and women that populate the rooms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese comments are not meant to legitimize the ever-present culture of body shaming that exists in our society, however, and must be put in the perspective of the high rates of health disorders related to body insecurities (such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders) that exist in our country. As human beings, we have an obligation to call out body shaming when we see it. However, this is different than making broad umbrella statements about media and our society, which do not account for the diversity and complexity of the institutions in question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen beginning conversations on body image, it is tempting to oversimplify the problem by creating cut-and-dry antagonists out of massive institutions with many diverse parts. I argue, however, that this method does more harm than good. It refuses to recognize the complexities that exist—the positive as well as the negative aspects of media; the health benefits and the fear of being judged at the gym; the tremendous sense of body-acceptance at some Greek organizations in the United States, and the strict rules of beauty in others.

What angered me more was that the artist won an award for this song in Korea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy friend provided me another perspective: the award was well-deserved because this song captured the cold, honest, and true feelings of someone in a relationship. He\u002FShe may be completely in love with his or her partner (hence the “Don’t you ever cheat on me”), but as a human being, is attracted to other people around them (hence the “Even if I cheat on you”).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat, then, does a song produced in a foreign country halfway around the world have anything to do with the Super Bowl this year? The Super Bowl commercials, which I appreciate more as an international student who has yet to understand the significance of football, this year focused on social issues such as domestic violence and childhood accidents. These commercials, bringing awareness to issues we as a society need to address, obviously received well-deserved appreciation. The question is, then, what role should the media play in terms of morality? Should media produce generally ethically-sound media or show the multi-faceted sides to an issue, as artist Taeyang did?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo play Devil’s Advocate here (perhaps this will give away my stance before I even start my persuasion process), society’s moral compass is constantly turning. The standard of what is good and bad, right and wrong is never holistically the same across cultures and time. Even with the religious aspect, the custom beliefs of what actions are deemed good and bad are, once again, different across cultures and time. If the moral compass never stops to point North but rather swings around a spectrum, would not most, if not all, media technically be ethically and morally sound since there is no set standard of morality and ethics?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we forget sometimes is just how powerful media is, especially to our generation. Media, whether that be through social media, journalism, televised media, or even just music listened through Spotify, is a factor that is increasingly more influential on us. We have come to a point where it is not just us that influences what media is produced but the media we produce is also influencing who we are as individuals and a community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest example of this is the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Ice Bucket Challenge which, through media, raised over $100 million. It is a classic example of how we influenced the media (by participating in the Ice Bucket Challenge) and how that in turn influenced, or will influence us (by hopefully creating a world without ALS).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedia, however, can also negatively skew our perceptions about certain people and places. The prime example is that of the Middle East and North Korea. Because the world is becoming smaller to us than it physically is, we learn to breathe in stereotypes about certain countries and cultures without visiting them. Perhaps these stereotypes and information we know about certain countries are not completely falsified, such as North Korea. The government is definitely dictatorial and they most likely do have nuclear weapons. However there is much more to the country than one ruler. There are 24.9 million citizens of North Korea that we could be concentrating on, but the media skews our perspective to focus on the one ruler, Kim Jong-Un through their heavy coverage on him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Middle East and Islam have suffered great injustice when it comes to American Media. Acts of violence and terrorism have often been attributed to Islam, a religion of 1.6 billion adherents. Media channels with a vast audience fail to differentiate between correlation and causation, ultimately leading their audiences to have an uninformed and skewed opinion. This idea manifested itself on Furman’s campus through the most recent CLP, Understanding and Misunderstanding Islam, where the majority of the questions for the panel speakers hinged around the correlation between Islam and terrorism. It takes no more than a simple conversation or a few minutes of proper research to realize that Islam does not promote terrorism, just as Christianity does not promote slavery, the Crusades and other horrendous acts that Christianty was used to justify in the past. It would be hypocritical to generally condemn a whole faith group, without having condemned others who could also be seen as guilty of the same crime.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe media is not only widening the gap between peoples and cultures by creating a superficial “us and them” divison, but it is also harvesting deep hatred and resentment on both sides, making the possibility of reconciliation drift further and further away from reality.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider this, then: if the idea of good and bad is relative to culture and time, it means that it can be shifted to a certain degree. Media is very powerful and can change said idea of good and bad. Shouldn’t such a powerful form be used to drive us toward a future that we want to live in? Shouldn’t we use media to attempt to create a utopian society for the future? Some may consider this idea absurd and overly-optimistic. Think what you may, but without thinking optimistically we will never reach an optimistic world. Likewise, if we do not use media to try to gear our moral standards to where we want them to be, we will never live in such a society.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82d51",name:"EDITORIAL: MLK’s Legacy Ignored",slug:"mlks-legacy-ignored",timestamps:{published_at:"2015-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["editorial","issue9"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003EThe beginning of second semester is a busy time for the Furman community.

Administrators later remembered Vaughn’s enrollment as their proudest achievement, and reflecting on desegregation fifty years later, there is much we can celebrate about Furman’s story. In the early 1960s, hundreds of students and professors wrote letters, cast ballots, and gave speeches in support of desegregation. Finally, Oct. 8, 1963, Furman became the first private university in South Carolina to pass a non-discriminatory admissions policy. Furman agreed to wait a year while the Baptist Convention studied the issue, but when, in 1964, the Convention “recommended” that Furman remain segregated, the trustees defied that recommendation and opened admission to “all qualified applicants.” Vaughn enrolled the following month, and in his own words students accepted him as “just another regular guy.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be easy, therefore, to simply celebrate Furman’s successes, but doing so would ignore the complexities of the past and the challenges of the present. For years, the university was deeply divided over desegregation. Though liberal editors used The Furman Hornet (now The Furman Paladin) to call for desegregation as early as 1954, their convictions remained unpopular; in a 1957 opinion poll, almost sixty-three percent of students voted for “absolutely no integration at Furman.” Administrators were just as reluctant. In 1953, they outlined a strategy that would enable the university to “operate on a discriminatory basis for years to come,” and two years later a faculty committee chaired by the Dean confiscated all 1500 copies of the student magazine The Echo for supporting desegregation. In 1961, when a poll revealed that students narrowly supported desegregation, the university’s alumni president assured critics that “as long as the present trustees and administrators are in control of Furman, we need have no fear of that University’s going against our Southern traditions.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs federal pressure for desegregation mounted, however, the university was forced to respond. As one trustee explained, desegregation was “not in agreement with our training and thinking, but nevertheless these decisions have been forced on states and institutions by the power of the federal government.” Though they voted to consider “all qualified applicants,” their level of commitment to the policy was made clear by their willingness to delay and disregard it. They voted to delay the policy in May 1964, and that December they were prepared to do so once again until Vice President Francis Bonner demonstrated that desegregation was an academic and economic necessity. If Furman remained segregated, he said, it could lose its accreditation, almost twenty percent of its faculty, and the federal and corporate funding upon which it depended. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 denied federal funding to any institution that discriminated on the basis of race, and Furman was therefore in danger of losing over $2 million in loans and grants. Bonner believed Furman “could not recover from this calamity within two decades.” His practical arguments carried the day, and the trustees voted to reaffirm their open admissions policy. Many at Furman understood that segregation was unjust, immoral, and (as the faculty unanimously proclaimed) “incompatible with basic Christian principles.” Ultimately, however, Furman’s desegregation was more about practical acceptance than principled statements; as The Greenville News recognized at the time, Furman “did the right thing, if for no other reason than the fact that…it was just about the only thing it could do.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn many ways, this reality reflects the experience of the entire South. Fifty years later, we think of civil rights as a finished, historical movement. We acknowledge the tragedy of segregation while placing it safely in the past, celebrating the Civil Rights Movement as the triumph of principle over prejudice and the actualization of the American ideals of justice and equality. Ironically, however, celebrating the successes of the Civil Rights Movement while ignoring that movement’s unfinished legacy enables us to unfairly delegitimize the protests of the present and the continuing cries for justice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should celebrate everything that was achieved fifty years ago, but we cannot pretend that those achievements alone entirely overturned the entrenched inequality of three centuries of structural injustice. The challenges of today are perhaps less tangible, but they are no less significant. In meeting those challenges, we must look to the past for perspective, but we must accept that past in all its complexity if we hope to truly move beyond it. We cannot reduce our history to a comfortable narrative of triumph, because doing so ignores everything that that triumph left undone. So, we must remember the hundreds of men and women who spoke so eloquently and believed so forcefully in justice, but we must not forget the men and women who fought so bitterly to defend their “Southern traditions.” We must remember the beauty and promise of our ideals, but we must not forget the ways we are still working to achieve those ideals. We must remember the passion and principles that made the victory of Jan. 29, 1965 possible, but we must not forget the reluctance and resistance that made that victory necessary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82d4b",name:"ZTA Hand Sanitizers: Killing Germs and Diversity",slug:"zta-hand-sanitizers-killing-germs-and-diversity",timestamps:{published_at:"2015-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628edb28",name:"Anonymous",slug:"anonymous",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["issue9"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003ELike the beginning of any calendar year, Furman’s 2015 comes with many “new” things: a new year, new classes, new New Year’s Resolutions, and a new sorority.

While it welcomes some young men and women into a community, its selective and sectarian nature establishes a palpable feeling of “us” versus “them.” It pits sororities against sororities, fraternities against fraternities, and Independents against Greeks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rush process, the annual culmination of sororities’ energy and values, divides and destroys students and classmates. For those who are not familiar with the recruitment process, the condensed version is this: sorority women pick and choose who they want to be in their clique based on a series of short-term (four minutes in some cases) interactions with potential new members. Reasons for “making the cut” vary depending on the particular sorority’s standards, but the results of the cuts are the same. Some student are in and some students are out. Affirmation and rejection. Inclusion and exclusion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen an organization that is so present, dominant, and influential on campus is fundamentally exclusive, imagine how student life would be affected.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParticipants are not the only ones harmed by the Greek system. The Independents, those who sit on the exterior of the entire process, are left to watch the insiders work so hard to ostentatiously display a sense of unity.

School-wide events such as Homecoming float-building and fundraising activities are unintentionally exclusively Greek.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there are certainly Independents who do not feel the weight of the exclusion, many do. The transfer rates among Independents are entirely too high. Too many unique minds have left Furman in search of a more open-minded and welcoming home.

If these minds are not connected, they will inevitably be lost to a more engaging and inclusive institution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82d4a",name:"Panhellenic and the Furman Community",slug:"panhellenic-and-the-furman-community",timestamps:{published_at:"2015-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97745bc989e23628ee020",name:"Panhellenic Executive Council",slug:"panhellenic-executive-council",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["issue9"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003ETo Our Furman Community,\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the primary purpose of our Furman University collegiate experience is academics, the average Furman student boasts far more involvement than attending classes alone. Our community at Furman is made up of a unique body of men and women, who exemplify not only high scholastic standards, but also exude interest and passion in extracurricular, volunteer, and social activities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne opportunity that combines each of these factors in our Furman community is that of Greek life; for women specifically, Panhellenic sorority membership. Panhellenic is the overarching umbrella organization for sororities, so in essence, it is the united front of our seven sororities at Furman. The opportunity for Panhellenic sorority membership is one that is enthusiastically selected, year after year, because it provides the potential for participation in many extracurricular categories. It is not purely a social opportunity, but also one of leadership, service, and scholarship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Panhellenic women, we are openly grateful for the contribution our women make to the Furman community. Our all-sorority grade point average is consistently high, boasting an impressive 3.3. Our volunteer hours are short of neither quantity, nor dedication, as we all enthusiastically participate in both local and national philanthropic organizations as part of our individual chapters. In addition, our Panhellenic women come together, united, to serve Circle of Sisterhood, an organization committed to shattering global educational barriers for women. Circle of Sisterhood is an organization served by Panhellenic women internationally, as it is the National Panhellenic Conference’s philanthropy, and even still, our campus was recognized this year at the Southeastern Panhellenic Conference for incredibly devoted involvement. Our community has also uniquely risen to the occasion of servant’s leadership by collaborating with our Interfraternity Council on an all-Greek local philanthropy, called Greeks for Greenville, benefitting Alexander Elementary with fundraising events, volunteer hours, and an annual Day of Service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs wonderful as our community is for those involved as Panhellenic women, we also understand that Greek letter organizations are not for everyone. After all, no extracurricular activity on our campus is able to boast the participation of the entire student body. Because our campus is made up of such a unique body of men and women, we have the utmost respect for women who have no interest in Panhellenic membership. As a result, we not only respect these women, but have also dedicated ourselves to serving these women, as sisters of Furman. We work each year to collaborate with Greeks and non-Greeks to put on events that serve the entire community of Furman, not Greeks alone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis year, our Greek Week (a week of events that one might imagine is exclusively for Greeks) encouraged participation from all students, asking for their collaboration on the philanthropic and social pursuits of the week, and especially their attendance of our SGA co-sponsored celebratory event at the end of the week. Other events planned and endorsed by the Panhellenic Council, such as our annual “Be Bold Month” in April, our “How About This Party?” sexual assault awareness program, and our freshmen reach-out event “Confidence as a Collegian” are not only open to Greek and non-Greek collaboration, but highly encourage it, and are advertised as events that welcome participation of Greek and non-Greek attendees alike. Indeed, the position of Vice President of Community Relations on Panhellenic Executive Council is one designed purely to bridge Panhellenic with other groups on campus and in the greater Greenville community, so that we are able to best serve all Furman students, not solely Greeks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that our contribution to campus as Panhellenic women is strong. However, we candidly recognize that our partnership with non-Greek members of the Furman community serves as a binding force, one that improves our community experience. We love our Panhellenic membership, and we believe that it has enhanced our Furman experience, and challenged us to serve as upstanding members of the Furman community. The central focus of Panhellenic as an international organization is to love and serve one another, despite individual organizations and individual letters. We as Panhellenic women readily believe in that principle, as it applies not only to other Greek women, but also more largely, to our entire campus. We look forward to continuing to strengthen and partner with all students, faculty, and staff as the collective Furman community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82d49",name:"The Next Fifty Years",slug:"the-next-fifty-years",timestamps:{published_at:"2015-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97745bc989e23628ee01a",name:"Maria",slug:"maria",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["issue9"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E Swearingen, Associate University Chaplain\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of this academic year, the Furman community has commemorated the 50th anniversary of racial desegregation on its campus.

It is painful work acknowledging past and present injustices.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, the university invited consultants to assess the faculty climate particularly in reference to gender equity.

I think we can do better.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if instead we asked, “How do those comments make my peers who are minorities on this campus feel?” or, “Why do members of our community think it is ok to say things such unkind things to their neighbors?” or, “What can we do to support our peers who feel violated and unsafe right now?”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe work of the university is a wild, robust experiment.

Students have recently been dissatisfied with the treatment of multicultural faculty members. We would like to share our concerns regarding the tenureship review process and the recent dismissal of a number of multicultural professors. The dismissal of multicultural professors at an alarming rate, given their already small presence on campus has raised concern within the student body. Hence, as student leaders, we have taken the initiative to have a better understanding of the situation and have since spoken with dozens of professors and staff members. Through this, we have learned that each of the multicultural professors who were dismissed or were asked to resign were frustrated with the due process provided to them. They have also indicated the existence of unconscious bias and microaggression from colleagues and staff.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese professors who prefer to remain anonymous, have cited discrimination; including but not limited to, racial, gender and religious discrimination. After probing into the situation with materials available to us, we have found no concrete evidence of wrongdoings by these professors that could have led to their dismissal or resignation. On the contrary, they demonstrated great strength in their area of expertise and showed strong enthusiasm towards their students.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs students at this esteemed educational institution, we hope that the university places an emphasis on mentorship and leadership. Some of these professors who were relieved of their position were not given prior warning of any wrongdoing, thus, eliminating their power to improve. Instead, they were given a showcase letter, terminating their contracts or were asked to resign almost immediately. Furthermore, these accusations of wrongdoing have not been substantiated by justifiable evidence. In addition, there has been a lack of support and due process from both the administration and the departments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are honored to have you as our 12\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E President and we are excited to work with you in making Furman a better place for all students, faculty and staff members.

We would also like the university to conduct a similar investigation into the existence of racial and religious discrimination among faculty members comparable to the recent gender study conducted.

The decision stemmed from Swift’s belief that Spotify does not fairly compensate artists and that the business lacks a sort of “inherent value placed on art.” According to Time Magazine, Swift was upset that she had been paid less than $500,000 - $496,044 in the last year for her songs. Borchetta, CEO of Taylor Swift’s record label, Big Machine, also spoke up in outrage, claiming that Swift earns more money from her videos on the video streaming site Vevo than she does through her contract with Spotify.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the artist’s true fans supported Swift, buying her album either through iTunes in local shopping centers, the rest of the public did not support Swift’s decision. Outraged by her decision, critics have said that Swift is ultimately selfish; she should share her music with the public.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs neither a die-hard fan nor a hater of Swift, I do believe that Swift, to some extent, has the right to be concerned about whether or not she is being properly compensated by the streaming sites that are taking over our social media world. That said, however, I also think that she is taking her concerns to the extreme, looking at the issue from the wrong perspective.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArtists produce music in order to share their passion to inspire their fans while sharing their personal stories and talents. Instead, Swift seems to be too focused on the political and business aspect of the music industry. In fact, boldly pulling her music from Spotify could potentially harm not only her career as an artist, but also her reputation as a person. All business, even the music industry, houses an ugly side wherever money is involved. Swift’s focus, however, should remain on why she became a singer in the first place, her hopes to share her music and talents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause there are ten million users or so who do have access to music from a large collection of artists on Spotify, I believe that it is actually a great instrument for artists, including both Swift and emerging new artists who want their music to be heard. It is only through putting their music in an easily accessible setting that people begin to know about them, sharing their music with their friends and increasing interest in artists’ concerts. We do not live in a perfect world and I believe music services such as Spotify and Pandora are the way for artists to get attention. This system actually works in their favor. Since you cannot download music from Spotify or Pandora, Spotify users are more inclined to purchase songs after listening to them, wanting to have the songs on their phones, iPods, or other pocket-sized portable devices.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaylor Swift made a stand against what she believed, but in the end, it seems like she was very shortsighted. Not only did she lose a portion of her dignity as a music-loving artist, she also lost a great platform for other listeners yet unfamiliar with her music to stumble across it and have a chance of loving it.

Events like Rocky Horror (CLP-accredited both Fall of 2011 and Spring of 2012, although, not since) obtain CLP credit while faculty recitals, Furman Engaged presentations, and OLLI’s informative Shakespeare showings do not. Students line up for CLPs long in advance only to hear that they can sit on the floor without attendance credit. Faculty members skip meetings to hear speakers only to be turned away at the door. Now it seems like the only way to get CLP credit is to attend ticketed events like a Playhouse Theatre productions that, while wonderful, require students to pay out-of-pocket for their academic experiences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EIn recent years, the CLP committee has established more rigorous vetting procedures to make sure that nonacademic CLPs do not get approved. Combined with Furman’s growing freshmen classes, however, these vetting procedures leave more student organizations trying to get CLP-approval for last-minute events hopeless. The committee might benefit from instituting stream-lined processes for academically-based organizations that have proved their CLP worth in years past while reviewing their overall distribution of approved events. This semester, in particular, many event advertisements use the tagline “CLP-pending”. This can mislead students on the actual CLP status only to find out at the door that they will not be receiving CLP credit. Editing the CLP review process could eliminate this problem. Whether shortening the time allotted to deciding whether an event is CLP-approved or not or prohibiting student organizations from faulty-advertisement, CLP-pending statuses can be prevented with extra caution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThe issue lies not only with the CLP committee. Event organizers need to take into account the increased numbers of potential attendees and correctly choose a location big enough to house the many crowds of students wanting to attend interesting CLPs. International Festivals providing food have a long history of being maxed out. Events such as these that have a history of having to turn eager students and faculty (who have just as much a right to attend these events as others) away need to adjust their setting for future events. Rather than host popular CLPs in small rooms like Daniel Recital Hall or Patrick Lecture Hall, organizations should reserve larger rooms like Watkins or McAlister Auditorium. This allows space for many more students and community members to attend the event. The CLP committee also needs to take note of popular CLPs and prepare extra CLP cards for these events and advise student organizations to change their locations the next time the event requests CLP status.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThese problems are not the result of a single person or department. They cannot be solved with a single systematic overhaul or attempt at CLP reform. Yet the Cultural Life Programs are at the core of what Furman, as a liberal arts institution, attempts to do. They provide opportunities for all those in the Greenville community to expand their horizons, exposing us all to new ideas that have the power to change our community and our world. In fact, we, as a paper, would like to see the CLP system expanded whether by categorizing CLPs to make sure students attend a diverse variety of events or by staging intentional discussions and themed weeks built around increased engagement in CLPs and the issues they discuss.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThe issue is not in the lack of expansion of the CLP program but the survival of it. Due to problems like those Furman is facing right now, institutions around the Upstate are decreasing the importance of these kinds of experiences in their curriculums. Presbyterian College has cut back on their CEP system, requiring students to obtain only two CEP credits in order to graduate. Lander University requires students to obtain 15 FAL credits.

In her Youtube video “Damsel In Distress,” critic Anita Sarkeesian illustrates how women in video games are unjustly portrayed as weak and fragile creatures. Sarkeesian, other feminist critics, and supporters argue that female characters and, thus, females are sexualized, victimized, and abused through the depiction of women in the gaming industry. This prompted the #GamerGate movement. In video games, clichéd damsels-in-distress are “female characters reduced to a state of helplessness from which they require rescuing by a typically male hero for the benefit of his story arc.” On the other hand, gamers believe that this is merely a marketing strategy to capture the attention of their primary buyers -- young adolescent males. This then brings us to the question: Is the video game industry filled with misogynists, or is it “justifiable” that these programmers are intentionally portraying women to fulfill young male fantasies and promote their products?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EUnfortunately, this controversial topic has exceeded disagreement in opinion; it has escalated to the point where feminist critics everywhere including Sarkeesian and game developers Brianna Wu and Zoe Quinn have been forced to leave their homes and retreat into hiding with their family and friends. Because of their involvement in the gaming industry, these women have received dangerous death threats from gamers within their communities. Many gamers have gone so far as to Photoshop images of the developers being violently raped by video game characters. Other gamers have constantly harassed Sarkeesian, Wu, and Quinn on social media via Twitter, even discussing how to convince Quinn to commit suicide.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EGaming journalism poses questions on ethical implications of society. As it operates today, the video game culture promotes sexism. In many of the examples given by Sarkeesian, we can see that many female characters portrayed in games are in fact prostitutes or lower-tier, non-important characters lying off to the sides in sexual positions. These characters are often dressed in skimpy clothing, batting their eyelashes, existing solely to seduce video game players. They seem to be there to undermine the notion that women can be on an equal level with men, especially within the gaming world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThe problem does not lie in the gaming characters themselves, but in the social implications and misconceptions these characters instill in young gamers. Adolescent males bombarded by these images are taught wrong ideas of how they should view and treat women in real life scenarios. Some may say that there is a distinct line drawn between the gaming world and reality -- that the young gaming teenagers are merely goofing off in a fictional universe and in real life, they know better. This is where we have misconceptions. Being exposed to games such as “Grand Theft Auto” -- a game notorious for its misogynistic male characters -- may not necessarily lead men to sexually and violently abuse their partners later in life, but they certainly do not help boys learn how to respect women or view them as equals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EIn response to the previous argument that feminists are being too extreme since these games are constructed this way merely in order to appeal to the young male audience, I disagree completely. Yes, it is a known fact that many gamers are men, but at the same time, we cannot completely disregard the percentage of women who also enjoy video games. Women, by no means, should be discouraged from participating in an activity that their male counterparts participate in and have the privilege of enjoying because it is a male-majority participation activity. Explicitly using the argument that “only men play video games anyway” is not only sexist and false. It is contradictory. If no women played video games, the online movement #GamerGate would not exist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E#GamerGate opponents are correct in one of their stances: we should be living in a world without #GamerGate. This is not because women should be excluded from the gaming industry or because people around the world should turn a blind eye to blatant sexism in video games. Rather, we should be living in a world in which both men and women exist as equals in the gaming industry and around the world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82d3a",name:"Technology in the Classroom: Inclusion of Student Population",slug:"technology-in-the-classroom-inclusion-of-student-population",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-11-20T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["technology"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fik.imagekit.io\u002Fpaladin\u002F2014\u002F11\u002F5539473981_8a0fe210a2_o.jpg",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Jonathan Painter, Class of 2018\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EWith computers, iPhones, iPads, voice recorders, and now, smart-watches, it is clear that technology plays a major role at Furman, both in and out of the classroom.

Instagram contests or school-sponsored apps can be fun and useful for those who can afford the technology needed to participate, but if we rely too heavily on our technology, then students who cannot afford these luxuries stand at a serious disadvantage. Not only that, this is a self-perpetuating cycle -- students with the technology can benefit from cheaper digital textbooks.

I do, however, believe that a person has a right to end his or her own life. Maynard wrote in her letter to CNN, “After months of research, my family and I reached a heartbreaking conclusion: There is no treatment that would save my life, and the recommended treatments would have destroyed the time I had left.” Why then, should Brittany be condemned for her intended death when she already knew that her quality of life, as she knew it, would be gone?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EI have a strong conviction that there are many people out there, including Brittany and me, who would prefer quality over quantity in life. Rather than going through chemotherapy or an invasive surgery, singeing off all the hairs on her scalp, completely changing her outside appearance, or even risking losing herself as a person, Brittany chose to live her last days to the fullest. Consequently, she avoided letting cancer end her life; instead, she became the one to end her cancer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EPeople who commit suicide are usually blamed for leaving their beloved ones with wounds that cannot be healed, for disregarding all responsibilities they have towards their family members and friends, for disrespecting the role they may have played in others’ lives. Brittany’s situation is not a parallel to this. She did not intentionally break her family apart; she was responsible for her beloved ones; and most of all, she treasured her life. Instead of lying helplessly in a hospital in California, letting the malignant tumors gradually eat her brain and her body, making her family and friends see that heart-tearing image of her, she decided to spend the most precious time of her life with her family, fulfilling her bucket list by visiting the Grand Canyon. In her final stages of life, Brittany volunteered to advocate for access to Death-with-Dignity. All her thoughts, behaviors, and emotions proved that she loved her family, her friends, and herself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThere is no argument as to whether suicide is good or bad.

In her Youtube video “Damsel In Distress,” critic Anita Sarkeesian illustrates how women in video games are unjustly portrayed as weak and fragile creatures. Sarkeesian, other feminist critics, and supporters argue that female characters and, thus, females are sexualized, victimized, and abused through the depiction of women in the gaming industry. This prompted the #GamerGate movement. In video games, clichéd damsels-in-distress are “female characters reduced to a state of helplessness from which they require rescuing by a typically male hero for the benefit of his story arc.” On the other hand, gamers believe that this is merely a marketing strategy to capture the attention of their primary buyers -- young adolescent males. This then brings us to the question: Is the video game industry filled with misogynists, or is it “justifiable” that these programmers are intentionally portraying women to fulfill young male fantasies and promote their products?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EUnfortunately, this controversial topic has exceeded disagreement in opinion; it has escalated to the point where feminist critics everywhere including Sarkeesian and game developers Brianna Wu and Zoe Quinn have been forced to leave their homes and retreat into hiding with their family and friends. Because of their involvement in the gaming industry, these women have received dangerous death threats from gamers within their communities. Many gamers have gone so far as to Photoshop images of the developers being violently raped by video game characters. Other gamers have constantly harassed Sarkeesian, Wu, and Quinn on social media via Twitter, even discussing how to convince Quinn to commit suicide.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EGaming journalism poses questions on ethical implications of society. As it operates today, the video game culture promotes sexism. In many of the examples given by Sarkeesian, we can see that many female characters portrayed in games are in fact prostitutes or lower-tier, non-important characters lying off to the sides in sexual positions. These characters are often dressed in skimpy clothing, batting their eyelashes, existing solely to seduce video game players. They seem to be there to undermine the notion that women can be on an equal level with men, especially within the gaming world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThe problem does not lie in the gaming characters themselves, but in the social implications and misconceptions these characters instill in young gamers. Adolescent males bombarded by these images are taught wrong ideas of how they should view and treat women in real life scenarios. Some may say that there is a distinct line drawn between the gaming world and reality -- that the young gaming teenagers are merely goofing off in a fictional universe and in real life, they know better. This is where we have misconceptions. Being exposed to games such as “Grand Theft Auto” -- a game notorious for its misogynistic male characters -- may not necessarily lead men to sexually and violently abuse their partners later in life, but they certainly do not help boys learn how to respect women or view them as equals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EIn response to the previous argument that feminists are being too extreme since these games are constructed this way merely in order to appeal to the young male audience, I disagree completely. Yes, it is a known fact that many gamers are men, but at the same time, we cannot completely disregard the percentage of women who also enjoy video games. Women, by no means, should be discouraged from participating in an activity that their male counterparts participate in and have the privilege of enjoying because it is a male-majority participation activity. Explicitly using the argument that “only men play video games anyway” is not only sexist and false. It is contradictory. If no women played video games, the online movement #GamerGate would not exist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E#GamerGate opponents are correct in one of their stances: we should be living in a world without #GamerGate. This is not because women should be excluded from the gaming industry or because people around the world should turn a blind eye to blatant sexism in video games.

I do not think anyone wants our campus police to be putting effort into getting students in trouble, and although at first glance this may seem like FUPO is trying to get students in trouble, I am here to tell you that is not their intention. When I spoke with Police Chief Tom Saccenti about the issue, he agreed that he does want the students to feel like the Police Department is out to get them. Why does FUPO feel it is necessary?

This is why the Officer Saccenti felt the need to hold a meeting and bring up the conversation about having DUI checkpoints on campus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThe letter went on to say, “…we will publicize the checkpoints in a very transparent way.

Yes, FUPO wants us to use designated drivers and be safe and responsible because they genuinely do care about our lives. In addition, a mention of having DUI checkpoints last semester with 100 percent of the drivers having been sober appeals to parents in the admissions office alike. Maybe one of the ulterior motives of this engagement is to be able to depict the university as a safe place which I believe most of the student body would say is a fair statement to make.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EWhat I care about, as a fellow student, is the fact that they let us know.

This makes me feel like the Furman University Police Department is getting one step closer to acting like an older brother looking after us, rather than an authority figure wanting to get us in trouble.

The editorial suggested that the Career Fair was skewed toward accounting, business, and management employers, and pointed out that other areas, such as science and technology, were not represented. Those of us in the Career Center were puzzled by this because there were organizations in attendance that recruit from these disciplines - Michelin, Milliken, and Ortec are three examples. It is not clear why this was omitted from the article.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EWhat many people do not know is that in college career center recruiting across the country - not just at Furman - there has always been a disproportionate number of business\u002Fcorporate employers represented in Career Fairs and on-campus interviewing. The reason for this is that corporations are better staffed and have more resources to send recruiters to various campuses. Non-profits, governmental agencies and other relatively lower-funded organizations usually do not have the same financial ability to keep recruiters on the road as do the major corporations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThere is also a common misconception that college career centers are not doing their job when a specific company, or type of company, is not seen on the list of employers participating in a Career Fair.\u003Cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003E \u003C\u002Fspan\u003EThe reality is that every employer is selective in where they send their recruiters. The more “active” employers often develop lists of target schools they will engage with for on-campus recruiting. A variety of factors are considered when making these decisions (i.e. student population, variety of majors, percentage of students entering the job market vs. graduate school, location\u002Fproximity to a major city, alumni relationships, perceived “fit,”). The number of target schools for each employer is more conservative (and rigid) than most may assume; even the largest employers rarely recruit on more than three to five percent of college campuses - and that is the largest corporations; most employers recruit on less than one percent of college campuses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EBecause of our size, Furman can be at a disadvantage since we generate fewer employment-seeking candidates than larger, public and private institutions (on an annual basis, about 40 percent of new Furman graduates report pursuing graduate school over employment). Faced with this reality, the Furman Career Center takes a proactive approach and we diligently invite hundreds of employers to recruit in some capacity, whether that be by attending the Career Fair, hosting individualized recruiting events (like an information session), setting up on-campus interviews, or posting full-time opportunities to the Paladin Job Board. Included in these invitations are dozens of employers in industries that Ms. Dills’ editorial suggested that we do not target including the sciences and other underrepresented sectors. So while we may not have had the diversity of employers Ms. Dills thought we should have at the Career Fair, when it comes down to it, we can encourage employers to attend but we cannot force them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThe suggestion in the editorial that we expand our services to help students outside of just the business fields shows a lack of understanding of what we do in the Career Center. We have always provided career assistance for students interested in non-business areas. What is important to understand is that our most effective job search assistance is not through the on-campus recruiting programs - those that have a lot of visibility like the Career Fair - but by working with students individually and referring them to employers and alumni with whom we have connections in a broad variety of career fields. These connections include hundreds of employers and thousands of alumni that do not necessarily participate in the Career Fair or other on-campus recruiting programs. We work with students seeking both business and non-business careers every day and have countless success stories.
