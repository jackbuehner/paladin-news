Which of these two massive pop stars would take home the night’s biggest awards? Despite all of the hype surrounding those two, the evening ended up belonging to some very different, unexpected names. These were the highs and lows from an always captivating and always divisive evening of music.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EHighs\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChance the Rapper\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E: For my money, the unequivocal winner of the evening was Chicago-bred hip-hop star Chance the Rapper, who broke out in 2016 with the release of his effervescent, gospel inspired mixtape, “Coloring Book.” Chance has garnered lots of press for his decision not to sell “Coloring Book” (or any of his previous mixtapes) and many wondered if that choice would hurt his chances at the Grammys. But those debates were quickly settled, first when Chance beat out Maren Morris, The Chainsmokers and others for Best New Artist, then later when he bested titans like Drake and Kanye West for Best Rap Album and finally when he turned in a brilliant, spine-tingling performance of “Coloring Book\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E standouts “How Great” and “All We Got.” Chance’s energy and enthusiasm was unfortunately lacking throughout most of the evening, but when he was on stage the show came noticeably to life.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EA Tribe Called Quest: \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EFurther proving what a great night this year’s Grammys was for hip-hop were ‘90s rap icons A Tribe Called Quest, who dedicated their performance to MC Phife Dawg, an original Tribe member who passed away in 2016. And what a performance it was. The legendary group proved they haven’t lost any of their mojo with a thunderous version of recent single “We the People…” which finished with an impassioned cry for “resistance,” a rare political moment in an otherwise uncontroversial evening. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EKaty Perry\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E: The female pop star who managed to deliver on Grammy night turned out not to be Adele or Beyonce, but Katy Perry. Performing her terrific new single “Chained to the Rhythm” alongside Skip Marley, Perry wisely nixed lip-syncing in favor of a fun, creative, energetic and, best of all, authentic performance, one which turned attention where it should’ve been, to the music rather than the artist. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETwenty One Pilots\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E: The prides of Columbus, Ohio may not have performed on Grammy night, but the indie pop duo still had one of the most memorable moments of the evening (and even got a shout-out from Ohio governor John Kasich) when accepting the award for Best Pop Duo\u002FGroup Performance in their underwear.

As written by Randall David Cook and acted by the excellent cast, the characterizations of sorority sisters and fraternity brothers hits the sweet spot between reality and comic exaggeration. They’re caricatures, of course, but just barely, and the show is the better for that. Too far over the top and our heroes and heroines would have been insufferable; instead, they play straight to the truth behind every joke, to the delight of every college student in the audience. My favorite gag involved a trio of sorority pledges who, by virtue of all being named “Heather,” are treated by the rest of the cast as a single unit (at one point, after people have begun to disappear in earnest, a hysterical girl cries out: “I can’t find the Heathers!

So what better way to pump some life back into the character than to turn it into Lego form? Reprising his role from “The Lego Movie,” Will Arnett (“Arrested Development”) voices the titular hero, lending a signature gravelly voice to the movie and endless compliments to himself. This proves most effective in the opening 30 minutes, which is undoubtedly the best segment of the film. It begins, as almost every Batman movie does, with the procession of a crime. Led by the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) and featuring probably every villain in the canon, the heist involves strapping a bomb to the underwater stronghold of Gotham City. But, after numerous self-aware quips and references, Batman inevitably comes in to save the day. This sequence was surprisingly stunning for an animated film, blending color and quick takes that all felt simultaneously like an homage to and an improvement on the franchise. Once Batman defeats the Joker, he goes one step further and tells his famous foe that the Joker’s not his number one bad guy, and that Batman doesn’t need anyone to help him fight crime. In a wonderful spoof, this breaks the Joker’s heart, and we go on to find that Batman’s cockiness and isolation is really just a disguise for his crippling loneliness. He spends most of his days alone in the Batcave with Alfred (Ralph Fiennes), watching “Jerry Maguire”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Eand pretending to not be sad about his dead parents. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThen, everything seems to spiral out of control for our hero. The new commissioner (Rosario Dawson) insists that Batman isn’t the only way to defeat crime, Bruce Wayne accidentally adopts an orphan named Dick Grayson (Michael Cera) and the Joker is behind the scenes, organizing the greatest supervillains for an attack against the city. At this point, the majority of animated movies would cop out and have a nonsensical battle and a predictable conclusion with no real emotional stakes, but that is where “Lego Batman”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Ediverts. Instead, the physical crisis of the villains taking over the city coincides with Batman’s personal crisis of shutting people out. He must combat the fear of losing people close to him by not relying on himself to be the sole hero. While the message of “The Lego Movie” was to be yourself, the message here is to let other people in on that process. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ELike any great animated film, it ends with humor, action and a resolution where everybody’s happy.

If you attended the Gullah Geechee Connections Cultural Life Program event (CLP), you will remember these sounds quite vividly from Tuesday, Feb. 16; however, even if you weren’t in attendance, I hope to convince you of the enigmatic energy evoked by speaker Ronald Daise that had even the most worn out Furman students producing these joyful sounds.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EBorn into a family of nine children on Saint Helena Island in South Carolina, Ron Daise grew up in a region rich in Gullah-Geechee history. Daise wears many hats as an author, performer, educator and singer-songwriter, but in every role he takes on, Daise serves as a Gullah Geechee Preservationist. Gullah has been coined by some to refer to the North and South Carolina coasts, while Geechee typically refers to the coastal areas of Georgia and Florida; however, the joined term, Gullah-Geechee, encompasses the language, culture and people of both these areas. West African slaves, from countries like Sierra Leone and Ghana, were placed specifically in these Southeastern parts of the United States because they were “well fnown fa growin’ rice,” as Daise’s song states. The term Gullah-Geechee began to emerge to describe these distinct pockets of West African communities. Despite its rich cultural roots, some members of these communities, even Daise himself, have felt shame in self identifying as Gullah-Geechee, believing their heritage was born solely out of the institution of American slavery. However, in his CLP, Daise illuminates the powerful connections between the Gullah-Geechee culture and Western Africa with hopes that people will find a renewed pride within the Gullah-Geechee name.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“Everyone when in Ghana, can drop their masks…and just be free.” This quote from one of Daise’s poems poignantly describes his first trip to Ghana in 2004, where he first experienced the striking resemblances between Western Africa and Gullah Geechee. Daise not only points out the shared physical attributes between Gullah Geechees and West Africans, but also revealed the many other interconnections between the two cultures. One of these similarities was language, as many Gullah Geechee words are rooted in West African languages. While some people delegitimize the Gullah language by attributing its unique dialect to its speakers so called “large lips or low intellect,” this language actually originated out of necessity aboard slave vessels. West African slaves from different areas used this new language in order to bridge the gap between their individual languages and communicate with one another. Through the fable of Anansi the spider, Daise underscored the cultural importance or storytelling or “swapping lies” in both West Africa and Gullah Geechee regions. Finally, Daise emphasized another connection: food. Rice not only makes up a large portion of these communities’ diets, but also is used in special delicacies, such as a favorite dish composed of black eyed peas and rice known as Hoppin’ John. Throughout his presentation, Daise transcended beyond the standard lecture as he sang songs, recited poetry, told stories and taught vocabulary lessons. Daise’s interactive style not only kept his audience engaged, but also breathed new life into this deeply rooted culture. Through this and other CLP events hosted by Furman’s chapter of NAACP, the Furman community has the opportunity to learn about the many different aspects encompassed in Black History Month.

Wylder Cooper’s lighting, for example, was great, as was the orchestra, helmed by music director Drew Whitlow.

Brie Larson, Jason Reitman, Glenn Close and other past nominees\u002Fwinners described their experiences of being nominated, and then went on to announce nominees for this year, category by category.

Previously set by “All About Eve” and “Titanic,” this all-time record was tied by the L.A. musical in all the “big five” categories (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay) along with two songs, score, and several other nominatinos.

She was undoubtedly pushed out by Meryl Streep (a record 20th nomination) who was almost definitely only nominated for her Golden Globes speech, which was largely Anti-Trump and pro-arts, so it naturally caused controversy. And as for the Golden Globes, Aaron-Taylor Johnson won Best Supporting Actor for “Nocturnal Animals.” While a win there typically translates into an Oscar nomination, Michael Shannon picked one up instead for the same movie. Other snubs included “Finding Dory”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Emissing from Animated Feature, “Manchester by the Sea”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Efrom Editing and “Annette Benning”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Efor Best Actress, but if those all sound like frivolities, it’s mainly because they are. To properly predict the winners, one has to pay attention to the smaller details and statistics. For example, many people said that “Birdman”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Ecouldn’t win Picture because it didn’t get an Editing nomination, that “Argo”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Ecouldn’t win because Ben Affleck didn’t make it in for Director or that “Spotlight” would lose because it was poised to only win one other award. It’s the annoyingly particular minutia that makes the Oscars less of an awards show and more of a statistics game. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs for the potential winners, most of these races have pretty clear endings already. Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”) and Viola Davis (“Fences”) will almost certainly win their respective Supporting categories. “Moonlight” will deservedly take Adapted Screenplay and as for the rest…well it’ll be “La La Land’s” night. With many nominations comes many wins, and calling it for winning Picture, Director and Actress would be a safe bet. As for now, I am predicting that it will win at least 10, more than any movie in over a decade. It’s no surprise that a film about pursuing your dreams in Hollywood did so well with them, but it’s also definitely not the exclusive reason. I’ll be rooting for Damien Chazelle (and his crew) on Oscars night, and if he wins, he’ll be the youngest Director winner ever at 32 years old. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThe 89\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Eth\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E Academy Awards will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel Feb 26 on ABC. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82ee2",name:"Manchester by the Sea Review",slug:"manchester-by-the-sea-review",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-02-11T04:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97745bc989e23628ee218",name:"Murphy Kenefick",slug:"murphy-kenefick",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["issue9","murphykenefick"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ESince January is usually the time when studios dump all their critically disappointing films into theaters, I would instead like to write about one of the year’s best films that still has a showtime or two: “Manchester by the Sea.” “Manchester” was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan and features Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams and Kyle Chandler. The plot draws our attention to Affleck’s character Lee Chandler, a janitor, who is forced to return home after the death of his brother. As if dealing with his own grief and trauma wasn’t enough of a burden, he also must take care of his nephew, and his brother’s estate. The bulk of the film is the relationship that these two develop, sharing memories of the departed, attempting to console each other (usually ineffectively) in the most masculine way possible. As the nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges) attempts to retain a normal high school life with girlfriends, hockey and a band.Meanwhile, Lee grapples with tedious funeral arrangements, unwanted relatives and an estranged ex-wife. The two try to handle all of this individually, but it’s not until the end that they discover that it’s not possible to handle everything on their own. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ELonergan’s previous two films “You Can Count On Me”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Eand “Margaret”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Efocus on grief as well, and the long, unsatisfying consequences that accompany it. The emphasis of his films is on the miniscule progress that his protagonists make rather than any character having a big moment, which would be fairly unrealistic. Instead of succumbing to the Hollywood cliché, Lonergan makes the audience sit patiently, watching Lee sulk, stare and retreat from conflict and conversation. Lee buries the pain instead of sharing it. Affleck gives one of the best performances of the year, conveying hurt, confusion and fatigue with each glance, all the while injecting occasional humor that the script calls for to lighten the mood. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThe location of Manchester, Mass. in the winter contributes so strongly to this icy, isolated character piece by making all the characters appear like islands, hoping to connect and resolve painful relationships, but never truly succeeding. Consistently throughout, there are complaints from the characters of it being cold outside, a seemingly obvious and yet recurring line … until it turns into a morbid joke, which is played for laughs. But then, in a different form, the cold becomes a breaking point for the Patrick, who crumples on the floor underneath the freezer, thinking of how his father is being preserved frozen. Without spoiling too much, everything is intentional, and while it might seem like much of the characters’ interactions are casual frivolities, it all adds up to something more, much like life itself. This blend of naturalism and grief is a tough balancing act, but in each conversation, silent pause and flashback, it all manages to coalesce into a greater whole. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EI had the privilege of seeing the European premiere of this film while abroad in England last semester as part of the BFI Film Festival, and before the screening began, the cast and crew introduced it. Lonergan discussed the difficulty of bringing such a messy, personal story to screen, and that much of the cohesion is owed to his lead actors, all standing with him. On that subject, Affleck, scruffy beard and all, elaborated on how challenging his role was. By keeping everything internal, there was risk of it appearing as if he wasn’t really acting at all. He figured out how to master it though, and is now the current front-runner to win Best Actor at the Oscars this year.If I had a ballot, he would certainly be my choice. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EWhile this film may be a heavy experience, rest assured that it is an enjoyable one, laced with humor and sharp characters, both of which makes the grief easier to bear.

The titular track, also the album’s first single, kicks things off with no shortage of blood and thunder. “It got me all fired up!” shouts King on the anthemic chorus. You can certainly say the same about the song, which is easily the band’s best to date and one of the best fist-pumping rockers of the last decade. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“Near to the Wild Heart of Life” is a hard act for the album’s other seven tracks to follow, but the track which does follow it immediately, “North East South West,” roars nearly as loudly. It’s a reflective ode to King and Prowse’s homeland of Canada and the respite it provides from the tribulations of an exhausting U.S. tour. It’s a theme that reappears on “Midnight to Morning,” where the line “bring me back home to you” becomes a battle cry for anyone who’s ever suffered a particularly nasty bout of separation anxiety. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EDespite all their sound and fury, Japandroids have commentary to make on love as well. “I’m Sorry (For Not Finding You Sooner)” is a distorted love song that sounds admittedly out of place in the grand scheme of the album. More successful is the charging “No Drink or Drug,” which tells of a “red ammo romance in the summer heat.” “No known drink, no known drug can hold a candle to your love” proclaims King to the “cool, hard beauty” of whose virtues the song extols. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EIt’s clear that Japandroids are trying to capture a timeless sound, but they do so with varying degrees of success. Closer “In a Body Like a Grave” is a working-class anthem that has at its heart the driving force of a song by Springsteen, Petty and other auteurs of the genre. But the proggy “Arc of Bar,” feels overly ambitious and wears out its welcome (as songs described as “proggy” are prone to do). \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EOverall, Japandroids is a band still struggling to find cohesion in the context of a full album.

He invites me inside and beckons me to take a seat. Instead of regarding me from behind a desk — separated by the authority of some great mahogany slab — he sits directly across from me, legs crossed, chair tilted back, perfectly at ease. Mr. Cook is an Artist-in-Residence, meaning that his time at Furman ends with the semester, but as we strike up a conversation — it’s technically an interview, of course, but all good interviews are conversations, gently guided — it becomes clear to me that he feels right at home. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAt first glance, this should come as no surprise; Cook is a Furman alumnus, class of 1991. His time as an undergraduate, however, was not marked by regular visits to the playhouse. “My parents told me that I was going to be a business major, so that’s what I did,” Cook said. Though he nursed passions for both theatre and writing, he only pursued them on an extracurricular basis.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“I was the Editor-in-Chief of the Paladin, and I wrote a weekly movie review for the Diversions section as well.

So at first I thought: fine, I’ll go into theatre, but the business\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Eside of theatre.” His first job lasted three weeks and two days. He was to work with James Goldman (the eminent playwright whose works include “The Lion in Winter” and the musical “Follies”), but there was a snag. “Goldman was great,” Cook recalls.

I complained and complained until finally they basically told me to put up or shut up, to either write a better play myself or stop going on about it.” This was the first of several plays that Cook has since written and gotten produced.

It scared me — no pun intended. It was so far outside my comfort zone. Nobody writes these kinds of plays anymore. People think that horror is only for the movies. I wanted to challenge that.” There’s comedy to be found in “Kappa Kappa Scream,” but make no mistake: it’s real horror. “It’s funny, but it’s not campy. We’ve got choreographed fights. There are death scenes. If we scare you, we’ll have succeeded.” He’s also playing a new role: that of professor. “It’s crazy to think about, considering what I do, but my first theatre class was one that I taught.”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EHe’s right at home with it, though, just as he is right at home in an office that will only be his for a few more months.

I couldn’t understand why. The teleplays for each of the eight episodes were written by Daniel Handler — Lemony Snicket himself—while Barry Sonnenfeld, Handler’s first and only choice to helm the production, was the man in the director’s chair. I had to conclude that this was exactly what Mr. Handler wanted the small screen version of his novels to look like, so why did the whole thing feel so wrong? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EIt wasn’t the show.

I spent the next month becoming intimately acquainted with the plight of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire, three orphans who find themselves in perpetual peril at the hands of the villainous Count Olaf, who is after the enormous fortune their deceased parents left behind. I loved those books, not so much for their unique tone — they presented their hammy melodramas with a bone-dry sense of humor that I mostly didn’t get — but because of their unique perspective. The Baudelaires were plucky resourceful protagonists. They had to be, because the adults in their lives were all either reprehensible monsters or blithering idiots, and the universe seemed uniquely committed to barring them from happiness. Their story perfectly articulated what it is like to be a child first trying to make sense of the world’s cruelties and contradictions. From a child’s perspective, the world can be an opaque, disorienting place where fate lashes out at you without warning, filled with adults who say and do inexplicable things for indecipherable reasons, even as they teach you that our world is one of absolutes: good and bad, right and wrong. The Baudelaires had discovered the gray area in between. I felt for them. I knew what a scary place that was.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EYou can imagine my disappointment, then, when the Netflix show turned out to be a laugh fest. Neil Patrick Harris’s comic timing has never been sharper, but his skills, I thought, were ill-suited to Count Olaf, a character whose appearance in the books used to make me shiver. Barry Sonnenfeld, meanwhile, seems to have taken a page out of Wes Anderson’s book, filling his frame with blatantly artificial, candy colored sets, conjuring up a world that is far too whimsical to be threatening. Patrick Warburton’s performance as Lemony Snicket convinced me that the comedy was not an accident. You don’t get Kronk from “The Emperor’s New Groove” to narrate your TV show unless you want that show to be relentlessly funny. How could the series have gone so wrong? What could have possessed Mr. Handler to turn his macabre meditation on what it’s like to be a child in an adult’s world into an absurdist farce?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThen I understood.

When the deck of fate always seemed stacked against them, I joined them in protesting the injustice of the universe. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ENow, more than a decade later, I’ve become an adult, all too aware of my own quirks, failings and contradictions. I still mourn injustice, but the fire is gone from my indignation, snuffed out by the cynicism that comes with age. I understand mortician humor now. I’ve learned to laugh at the inexplicable things that happen in our world, just as I’ve learned to laugh at the inexplicable misfortune of the Baudelaire children. I laugh now for the same reason that I took their story so seriously as a youngster: because I know that Mr. Snicket speaks the truth. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ENetflix’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events” is lovingly crafted and superbly entertaining.

Chazelle’s enthusiasm for jazz and movies is so abundant throughout that it will make anyone who shares these interests giddy.Even if you don’t share them, and you’re really not a fan of musicals (neither am I), never fear: it’s still an incredibly engaging story about how to make yourself work in the world, which is something everyone should be able to get on board with.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EWithout giving away too much, much of the beauty of this film is in the details and the moments. Naturally, it’s in the grand scale of its message and visual tone, but it’s also in the facial expressions, costume choices and the way that the music quietly weaves through the action. It would probably require repeat viewings to pick up on some of these things, but rest assured, this film is more than just a silly musical. In fact, as it progresses, the number of songs declines while the dramatic tension and empathy for the characters increase. This attention to detail is what makes “La La Land” so memorable.

For a movie about pursuing dreams of acting and writing in Los Angeles, it’s not surprising that it will receive a lot of love. However, I’ve heard it referred to as “Oscar bait,” a film made specifically for the Oscars for the sole purpose of winning awards. However, knowing that Chazelle has been writing this movie since his days in college with his roommate (Justin Hurwitz, who wrote the music), I find it hard to believe that this is anything other than a passion project. This delayed backlash often occurs to films that receive accolades later in the season; “Boyhood,” “Birdman” and “Spotlight” are some recent examples. Since those are remarkable films, and the disease of retroactive negativity always seems to attack at this time of year, I felt the need to defend this innocent, joyous little picture.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EIt gives me great pleasure to, for the first time while writing for this paper, give a movie a perfect score.

The usual silence that permeates Furman’s academic buildings after hours has been shattered by the Pauper Players, a student-run musical theatre company that puts on a full production each semester. This time around, the show is “Hairspray,” an irrepressibly upbeat musical that follows the teenaged Tracy Turnblad on her quest to prove her worth, find love and stand up to social injustice. Set in the early ‘60s, “Hairspray” boasts a soundtrack that plays like the earliest Rock ‘n’ Roll records, the rich textures of blues and gospel infused with that irresistible backbeat. The show demands relentless enthusiasm, and by the feel of the room, the Paupers have it in spades.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EInto this invigorating scene walks director James Douglas, who gathers the company with the chipper salutation “Come hither, young chaps!” Douglas, a senior, was the driving force behind the selection of “Hairspray.” He felt that the show, whose content confronts racial segregation in 1960s America, provided an opportunity to highlight the oft-overlooked diversity of Furman’s campus. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“I wanted to demonstrate that promoting diversity in school organizations was possible, and Pauper Players is a good place to start,” said Douglas. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ETo that end, Douglas reached out to FUGE, Furman’s gospel choir, to help make the show happen. “I took the idea to them before I took it to the Pauper Players,” he said, “and when they responded positively, I knew we could pull it off.” \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAfter talking the cast through some logistical odds and ends, Douglas hands the rehearsal over to music director Drew Whitlow. Music is the focus for the first half of the night; then, the cast will run the same numbers with choreography. ll those layers of learning make long ensemble rehearsals necessary. Lines and individual dance steps can be learned on one’s own time, but musical theatre is more than the sum of its various actors’ skills. The cast members must learn to coalesce as a performing unit, and that means spot work and seemingly endless repetition. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ENo one seems to mind, though.

And a food waste problem. That just doesn’t add up. In 2015, the USDA reported that 42.2 million Americans lived in “food insecure households.” And it’s not for a lack of food — as much as 40 percent of the food grown, processed and transported in the United States will never even be consumed. The equally shocking part? Color, shape, size and labeling are often key factors used to determine the quality of produce. Much of the 70 million tons of food that doesn’t make it to our plates is not rotted, damaged or even dangerous. It’s a banana that’s too big, a cucumber with a bump or chips that were labeled in English instead of French. Tons and tons of edible and healthy food is wasted each year somewhere along the food supply chain, from the farm to the table. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EUnfortunately, this waste accumulates in landfills, emitting serious quantities of methane and carbon dioxide, two major greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ECanadian filmmakers Grant Baldwin and Jen Rustemeyer decided to do something about it. In their documentary, “Just Eat It,” they live on food that would otherwise be thrown away, and they do it for six months. The film was shown Wednesday, Nov. 2 in Burgiss Theatre as a CLP event sponsored by the David E. Shi Center for Sustainability. The documentarian couple visits dumpsters, discount bins at grocery stores, farmer’s markets and even a food photo shoot to do their shopping. Unexpectedly, their journey exposes dumpsters full of untouched fruits, vegetables, meat, chocolate and prepackaged snacks, often thrown out for unknown reasons. The food they accumulate eventually becomes so overwhelming that they resort to letting friends and family take whatever they need from their home. Twenty thousand dollars worth of rescued food later, Baldwin and Rustemeyer find themselves 10 pounds heavier and paying a $200 grocery bill. That’s right —$200 over six months! \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ETristram Stuart, a food waste activist featured in the film describes the sensation best, “We live in a wealthy society that doesn’t have to eat leftovers, so we don’t.

What about right here, in Greenville County? I decided to find out for myself. I drove behind our local Publix one evening to see if I could catch a glimpse of anything like the unbelievable images captured in the documentary. What I found was quite contradictory. The dumpster seemed to be mostly empty and there were compost bins behind the building. I reached out to Publix over the phone and learned that our store donates to Loaves and Fishes, a local organization that rescues fresh food for the hungry. According to their website, Loaves and Fishes rescued 1.9 million pounds of food in 2015. The Food and Waste Reduction Alliance published a spotlight article on Publix in December of 2015 that features a Q&amp;A with Michael Hewett, Publix’s Director of Environmental and Sustainability Programs. According to this interview, the company pays close attention to customer demand to make sure unnecessary byproducts are not ordered. The leftovers that do accumulate are recycled, donated or sent to local farmers to feed their livestock. These initiatives divert thousands of tons of food waste from landfills, creating more sustainable business methods while feeding the hungry.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThere’s more good news —by eating in the Dining Hall, you are also contributing to sustainable composting and local farms. Eric Battles, the Executive Chef of Bon Appetit at Furman, gave me the inside scoop on where our food goes after hours. One hundred percent of our food waste is composted and returned to the soil at the Furman Farm, a quarter acre organic garden beside the Shi Center for Sustainability. Additionally, delicious vegetables like squash are grown on campus and then served right back to us. Bon Appetit also purchases produce, dairy and meats from local farms. Unfortunately, we are not currently part of a donor program to feed families that identify as food insecure, but it is encouraging to know that our food waste is not ending up in a landfill. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs a Furman student, you can rest easy knowing that your dining options and local grocery store are taking steps to eliminate food waste.

First, know what you have on-hand and what you need before you go shopping — and stick to it! Prioritize what foods need to be used first and take advantage of smoothies, soups and stews to use up large quantities. Don’t fall into label misconceptions; “use by” and “best before” dates indicate peak freshness, not safety. Preserve it: freeze it, can it, dry it or dehydrate it. Buy food that may not be ready for its close up — variations in size, shape and color can cause perfectly good food to be wasted. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs Baldwin remarked in the film, being a part of the change we wish to see, “doesn’t require a complete revolution in the way we treat food.

She is Ms. Chenoweth’s musical director and pretty much her best friend. When they conceived the show they committed to bring in different choirs for each performance to create a unique experience for each audience. I got the news that we would potentially fly to New York City to sing with Kristin Chenoweth on Broadway right after fall break. There were so many logistics that had to be worked out to make it happen – the flight, hotel, learning the music for our two pieces, getting 16 college kids moving in the same direction – but Dr. Floyd, the Furman Singers’ director, pulled it off!

To see the place where we all dream of singing one day was inspiring and slightly terrifying. We then sprinted off to find Times Square. At night Times Square is another world.

She is an incredible person and was such an inspiration. Campbell left Furman knowing she wanted to move to New York City to work on Broadway. We all sat and listened to her tell stories of her time at Furman and how she started Pauper Players, the student musical theatre group. She never thought it would carry on after she left, let alone become what it is today. We left with a better appreciation of just how much she does and how much work it all takes. Campbell showed us that if you love your work, then you will always find a way to push through on the days when you want to give up. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThat Saturday night at the theater reminded me why I want to dedicate my career to performing. As I was standing there on stage, the most nervous I had been in a long time, I was able to take deep breaths and look out at the audience. The adrenaline you feel on stage is incredible but I think the most amazing thing from the entire evening was how the audience reacted. Ms. Chenoweth was able to communicate with them and give them her authentic self through music. That is the power that music has. I know for a fact that not one person left that theater feeling bad. The fact that we got to play a part in that just made it that much more meaningful and made for an experience that I will always cherish.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82ec8",name:"Amanda Knox",slug:"amanda-knox",timestamps:{published_at:"2016-11-17T04:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628edb40",name:"Scott Harvey",slug:"scott-harvey",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["issue7","scottharvey"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ESarah Koenig’s influential podcast “Serial,” which told the true story of the trials and tribulations of convicted murderer Adnan Syed, set off a new wave of interest in the true-crime genre. Naturally, it was Netflix, which always seems to have its finger on the pulse of pop culture, that capitalized on this interest with the next big true crime hit, “Making a Murderer,” an absorbing murder mystery centered on Wisconsin man Steven Avery. Both of these examples showed the impact that media and pop culture can have even on something as sacred as our criminal justice system. Syed was granted a retrial in the midst of “Serial”’s popularity and new investigations have been conducted into the Avery case since the Netflix show.

In 2007 an American college student named Amanda Knox, along with her Italian boyfriend Raphaele Sollecito, was arrested for the murder of her British roommate Meredith Kercher, while studying abroad in Perugia, Italy. The gruesome crime soon became the stuff of sensation, a tabloid-ready story packed with drugs, sex and violence. It was quite simply, as British journalist Nick Pisa tells us in the film, the stuff of journalists’ dreams. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EBringing something fresh to such a familiar story is always difficult, but Blackhurst and McGinn have accomplished what no other telling of the story has managed so far. They’ve managed to get Amanda Knox to talk. Their unprecedented access to Knox, Sollecito and many other figures intimately involved makes this film a must-see for anyone interested in the case. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAnother struggle the filmmakers face is condensing the nearly decade-long story into a crisp 100 minutes, but it’s one which they manage to accomplish with style. Their recounting of the murder has enough of the important details to fill in those unfamiliar with the story, but it doesn’t beat the facts to death so as to bore someone who knows the case well. Whereas “Making a Murderer” focused a lot on the investigation into the murders, “Amanda Knox” is more concerned with the media’s impact on the investigation and on the lives of Amanda and Raphaele. And the directors have wisely chosen the smarmiest of villains, in Nick Pisa, to give the media’s perspective. The directors don’t have to hammer their point home because Pisa, who left me in slack-jawed astonishment with the pomposity and apathy of some of his remarks, hammers it for them. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EGranted, the film’s point about the life-changing effect that media sensationalism can have is a somewhat ironic one for a Netflix original to be making, given that “Making a Murderer” has been accused (and not without justification, I may add) of ignoring or deemphasizing some of the crucial facts in the Avery case. Nevertheless, one has to watch “Amanda Knox” on its own, without that context, and the truth is that the documentary has a devastating impact. By telling the story from all of the perspectives, its many dimensions begin to reveal themselves. Someone with only a basic understanding of the facts of the case may find it easy to blame a specific person for what ends up happening, but Blackhurst and McGinn’s film makes it clear that it’s much more complicated than that. They want us to see that there is a systemic problem at work rather than an individual one. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EHowever, I don’t mean to make the film sound overly didactic because as a piece of entertainment, “Amanda Knox” is gripping from beginning to end. Even though it’s clear where the filmmakers stand with regards to the case, there’s something chilling about the way the film opens and closes with Amanda narrating against a stark, gray background. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“People love monsters,” Amanda says in the final moments, and we still have to wonder who the monster she’s talking about is. If I have a complaint about the film, it’s that some of the recent developments in the story are somewhat relegated to the sidelines. The movie drops at least one bombshell in unassuming, on-screen text, as if it were a mere afterthought. But, make no mistake, this is a superb piece of work. Not only will it pin you to your seat, but it packs a profound punch that will force you to confront the role the media has in our society.

The dual part of the noble Dr. Jekyll and the murderous Edward Hyde was played by Furman’s own Josh Thomason, class of 2014. Students a year older than yours truly will remember him as the villainous Javert in the Pauper Players’ production of Les Miserables back in the spring of 2014. Even before that, however, Thomason was something of a Pauper Players institution, appearing in their productions of Company!, Spring Awakening and two Cabarets. Since graduation, he and his wife, Morgan, another Furman alum, lived in Chicago, where Thomason studied improvisational theatre, before happenstance brought him back to Greenville and into this production.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“Morgan had to have knee surgery, so we decided it would be best to go through that process back here at home,” Thomason said, “and not long after we got here, I heard about auditions for this show, and decided to try out.”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ELike its literary inspiration, Robert Louis Stevenson’s “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” the musical adaptation is centered on a man who, through some alchemic science of his own invention, tears his personality in two, forcing his virtuous and evil natures to do battle with one another for control over his thoughts and actions. For all practical purposes, Jekyll and Hyde are two completely different people, so playing them both — sometimes within a single scene — presented Thomason with a unique challenge.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“The most challenging thing was finding Jekyll, since he’s the more subtle of the two. The quality that I eventually latched onto was stillness. He’s a very still presence, upright and a little stiff. Hyde, on the other hand, is basic instinct, all primeval hunger and lust,\" Thomason said. \"The way I transition between the two was actually inspired by Andy Serkis’ performance in 'Planet of the Apes.' I was watching a special feature on the DVD where he demonstrated his physical transition from a man into an ape. I wasn’t even watching it to help with my performance, but when I saw what he was doing I thought: ‘that’s what I need for Jekyll and Hyde.'”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EIn the eyes of this reviewer, he succeeded. Thomason’s Jekyll is a good man, well-mannered and reserved, hobbled only by his blinding ambition and the resentment he feels towards the aristocrats who oversee his work at St. Jude’s Hospital, which he views as morally bankrupt men and women who hide behind the impenetrable veneer of respectability. Thus, his Hyde becomes something of a vigilante avenger, punishing those who trade on hypocrisy while committing his own sins proudly and openly. Jekyll stands quietly beneath street lamps, still as the night around him, while Hyde skulks his way around the production’s multi-tiered set, leaping from one platform to another, intoxicated by how alive his lust and thirst for power make him feel.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EI asked Thomason whether the roller coaster ride of playing such a character night after night had become a draining experience.

The Undergraduate Evening Studies (UES) “Word and Image” art exhibit examines the intersection between words and images in their shared ability to communicate stories, emotions and ideas to the viewer. The exhibit is a compilation of unique pieces chosen by Studio Art Associate Professor Michael Brodeur. The pieces were created by alumni, current students, instructors, staff and administrators of Furman’s undergraduate evening studies program, and the diversity of the creators is manifested in the diversity of their pieces.

I had never before thought about using quilting as a method of serious artistic expression in the contemporary art world, but this quilt immediately made me realize how art can be made out of anything. I learned that traditional crafting creations are just as legitimate an art form as using a paintbrush and canvas in a studio. The quilt seems to chronicle the lives of the artist’s grandparents using photos, letters and other such personal mementos to memorialize them. It was a sweet and comforting piece that reminds viewers how fulfilling life can be with those who love you.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAlthough there are many pieces in the gallery made from unorthodox materials, there are also many paintings and photographs which explore the combination of words and images.

These photographs studied how words can be used to make a statement about society and make readers consider how graffiti art may be a legitimate form of artistic and political expression when used in certain contexts. This is just one of many examples of how the UES exhibit makes visitors rethink their preconceptions about what art is and how it connects to written language.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThe UES Words and Images exhibit shows how bringing together the powerful media of language and visuals together can contribute to the overall beauty and meaning of individual pieces.

The cast also sits in the audience, waiting for Tromsness to call them to the stage for spot work. They are not in costume; those are optional at this point in the rehearsal process, with one exception: everyone wears their character shoes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Women of Lockerbie” takes place seven years after Pan American Flight 103 crashed into the little Scottish town of the title, killing all 243 on board and 11 people on the ground. The government’s investigation is finally over, but the characters we meet have yet to find peace. There is a group of local women who want to wash the clothes of the victims and return them to the families, and an American couple who have not gotten past the death of their son.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt’s heavy stuff, to be sure, but the actors dive right in, fearlessly embracing the tragedy of their characters, expressing crippling grief, sorrow and fear with fiery authenticity. Then they do it again. And again. And again. The actors’ ability to immerse themselves in their characters virtually on demand never ceased to amaze me during that rehearsal. Time and time again, they play a scene beautifully and powerfully — tearing me away from my feverish note-taking, forcing us to watch, transfixed — only for Tromsness to stop the scene, suggest a small change, then run it back to the start. Time and time again, they rise to the occasion, never once allowing fatigue or complacency to set in. When the scene has been played to everyone’s satisfaction, the actors casually return to their seats, awaiting the next call to bare their souls the way you and I await an open check-out lane at Walmart.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESal Donzella’s character has the first line of the first scene to be spot worked this evening. He begins: “Everyone in Lockerbie…”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETromsness stops him. “You’re doing that thing,” he says, referring to an unconscious kink in the actor’s gait. Donzella smiles and backs up to start the scene again, complaining genially about an issue that could only ever trouble an actor: “I’m thinking about walking too much.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter three hours of this, even I was exhausted; I can only imagine how the performers felt. There was just one scene left to rehearse: the moment when that bereaved couple finally finds peace. The ancient Greeks called this moment “catharsis.” The scene’s placement at the very end of the rehearsal was not accidental. It seemed to me that everyone present needed some catharsis in their lives. Thankfully, we got it. During the first run of that scene, a blooper occurred that caused the whole theater to erupt with laughter. They got it right on the next try, but enough residual joy was present to end the rehearsal on a happy note. As I left the theater, I recalled a moment earlier that night when Tromsness explained to the cast that there’s a lot of laughter to be wrung from despair.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“That’s what gives this play such impact,” Tromsness said. “It understands that in our worst moments, some of the funniest things can happen.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Furman theatre production is open to the public.

I can feel it from my head to my toes as we regard one another from across a little table. I’m looking to learn more about him. He already knows all he needs to about me. We are downtown, inside a chain coffee shop talking about the most recent product of Mr. Seay’s perceptiveness: the Reedy Reels Film Festival.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Two and a half years ago, I was vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. One night, the whole town was overrun — sold out. I asked my friends who lived there what was happening. They replied that is was the town film festival,” Seay said. “I thought to myself: ‘why doesn’t Greenville have something like this?’”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeay, a lifelong film buff and former professor of film at Clemson University, immediately set about making the idea of a Greenville film festival a reality. He enlisted three of his former students, Brooke Smith, Mike Jordano and Matt Foster, to help him forge the new festival’s identity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“We went out to other local festivals to see how they worked and what kind of events they hosted,” Foster said. “And we were particularly impressed by the Beaufort Film Festival up in North Carolina. After each film was shown, they hosted a Q &amp; A with the filmmakers. We knew we had to have that at our festival. The idea of directly engaging with the creative minds behind the films was and is very exciting.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first annual Reedy Reels Film Festival was held last fall at Clemson’s International Center for Automobile Research. This year’s edition will be held in the very heart of Greenville, at the Peace Center’s Gunter Theater, Nov. 4 and 5. Over the course of the weekend, the festival will showcase dozens of films. They range from short subjects crafted by local amateurs to feature-length productions helmed by professional filmmakers. One such professional is director Chris White, whose collection of short films, collectively entitled “Unbecoming,” is one of the festival’s big attractions this year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Film festivals are valuable because they allow people with all different ambitions to showcase their work. For hobbyists, getting to present their work on a big stage might motivate them to pursue their talents further. Or it might terrify them. For pro filmmakers, it gives them the chance to do something more creative than their corporate jobs,” White said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inherent cultural value of cinema notwithstanding, what does Reedy Reels bring to the greater Greenville community? According to Seay, “Reedy Reels offers the Greenville community a top-notch cultural event, at which they can see fascinating films, engage with the talented filmmakers and learn about the local filmmaking community.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor White, Reedy Reel’s greatest potential lies in getting so many filmmakers in the same room together. However, he is quick to point out that in the midst of the creative synergy fostered by the film festival environment, the line between artist and audience is not so hard and fast.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“For me, it’s like a magnet for potential collaborators. For people who come to festival, it’ll give them the opportunity to expand their palate, to see the kinds of films they would never see at Cherrydale, for example,” White said. “Thing is, though, that’s true for me as well. I’ll be in the audience, too.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter our interview, Seay invited me to come with him to the Gunter Theater, where he and rest the festival’s creative team would be shooting promotional videos for the festival. With the camera rolling, someone asked Seay where he was going to be Nov. 4 and 5.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Right here, at the Gunter Theater, for the Reedy Reels Film Festival,” he replied.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDitto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Reedy Reels Film Festival will be held at the Peace Center’s Gunter Theater Nov. 4 and 5.
