Between friends, parties, and that liberal arts education, finding time to think about healthy choices can seem nearly impossible. The key is to start early.

The tulips have been planted and have finally bloomed, baseball season is underway, and Furman students have left the confines of their dorms and apartments to enjoy this blissful weather.</div>

Between friends, parties, and that liberal arts education, finding time to think about healthy choices can seem nearly impossible. The key is to start early. Develop habits at the beginning of the year that will carry through the rest of your time at Furman and hopefully into your post-grad life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Fuel your body right.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E While the occasional burger and fries won’t kill you, it will make you more sluggish if enjoyed frequently. Ultimately, what you put in is what you will get out. A balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, grains, and protein will give you the energy and alertness necessary to succeed at Furman and beyond.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Manage your stress.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Face it, we’ve all let obligations build up until we just have to explode. It’s incredible how much a few deep breaths or a short walk help calm the nerves. Besides the obvious impact on your own health, overwhelming stress has negative effects on your personal relationships and self-esteem. A little stress makes us productive, but don’t let it get out of control. If you feel like you can’t handle the pressure on your own, go talk to the Counseling Center. Asking for help is not weakness—it’s the ultimate form of strength.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

Being active is one of the best things you can do for yourself, physically and mentally. Besides helping you look and feel awesome, working out gives your brain the break it needs to actually work better. The Physical Activities Center is a great place to sweat it out for a few minutes.

That doesn’t mean you have to get eight hours every single night. In fact, that might be impossible.

On a team that lacks strong receivers and running backs, this speedster has been taking snaps at both positions during training camp, and with more touches comes more opportunities to get your team points. He is also expected to return kicks and punts, adding even more value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● T.Y.

However, coming back from winning a Super Bowl and getting the biggest contract in the NFL, I think Flacco has the potential to have the best year of his career. The addition of Dallas Clark and Brandon Stokely will also help Flacco stay efficient as a passer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● Stevie Johnson, WR, Buffalo Bills\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe has gone over the 1,000-yard mark each of the past three years, averaging over 7 touchdowns per year in that span, and he’s done it on offenses that were some of the worst in the NFL. This year the Bills could have one of the best offenses they’ve had in a while with a competitive quarterback battle brewing between newly acquired Kevin Kolb and first round pick E.J. Manuel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● Fred Davis, TE, Washington Redskins\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe’s a fourth year player who’s always had an amazing upside but who’s been hindered by injuries throughout his career. However, because of his low perceived value, high productivity when healthy, and because Robert Lee Griffin III is at quarterback, I believe Davis could have a breakout 2013 and is worth a later round pick.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● Alshon Jeffrey, WR, Chicago Bears\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second string wide receiver on the Bears could have great productivity this year. He was not targeted as often as he should have been last year, but when he was, he was a force to be reckoned with. He has gotten more comfortable with the offense this off-season and looks to play a bigger role on a resurgent Bears team left with a bad taste in its mouth after last year’s playoff absence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● Carson Palmer, QB, Arizona Cardinals\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis veteran quarterback has had an up and down career thus far, but coming off a 4,000 yard and 22 touchdown season on the Raiders, I think his numbers should inflate this year on the pass-happy Cardinals. With weapons such as Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd, and Rob Housler, Palmer has the potential to have the same productivity he had during his Cincinnati days.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● Bryce Brown, RB, Philadelphia Eagles\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough he is the second string running back on his team, he might see a lot more touches this year under new coach Chip Kelly’s offense, which is known for running the ball and involving a lot of different players. He averaged 4.9 yards per carry last year as a rookie, and I believe he is good enough to continue to produce, even though he will play a more significant role on this year’s team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● Ahmad Bradshaw, RB, Indianapolis Colts\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new starter on the Indianapolis Colts has also had an up and down career. However, when on teams with strong offenses, he has excelled, and I believe the offense on the Colts has a lot of potential this year. People seem uncertain about Ahmad’s productivity this year, which has hurt his draft position, but I believe this uncertainty has created a great opportunity to pick up this running back, with starter potential, late in the draft.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E● Tyler Eifert, TE, Cincinnati Bengals\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETyler is a rookie out of Notre Dame who is a freak athlete and team player.

If you’re looking to escape a little more without leaving the campus, there are some trails through the Furman woods that are absolutely beautiful. However, for those who simply need to get off campus pronto, the Swamp Rabbit Trail is always a wonderful choice. This gorgeous paved path connects directly to the backside of the lake and can take you all the way into Downtown Greenville or Traveler’s Rest.

For one, I like to play drinking games WHILE I study. Every time I get a flashcard right, I drink. It’s a really successful game with an awesome incentive. And it works for like 45 minutes.

You’ll do the work of 15 hours in one intensely unstable evening!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you think you might fall asleep, put yourself in situations where there is no way you could sleep, even if you wanted to. I recommend studying in your apartment when you know your roommate’s going to be making sweet love to their out-of-town honey. Your body will be so put off by the awkward that it won’t even think to pass out on you! Listen to obnoxious dubstep. Study in places like crematoriums, if you have access to them. Nothing will keep you up like fear of accidental pre-mortem incineration!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter how you get there, you’re all going to finish the race.

In her living room sits two couches and a television set. On one side of the wall, King proudly displays wedding pictures of her and her husband from back in the day. There are also pictures of their two boys, now grown up and married.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard procedure for fortune telling is this: King will have you temporarily bid farewell to your friends who are there for moral support, and lead you into a small room located on the left side. The inside this room is not so standard; there is a significant display of Biblical images hung up on the wall (mostly of Jesus himself), Biblical figurines and plaques with Bible verses stenciled on them. In the room, there are two more chairs that are seated against either end of the wall.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou sit on one end facing her. She asks you to hand her $25 dollars in one hand, make two wishes, and then place the $25 on top of a Bible. Following this, she asks you to tell her one of the wishes you made, and the fortune telling goes from there. King gathers information on the type of person you are based from the energy of your aura, swaying back and forth and closing her eyes occasionally. She will reveal general information that you would want to know, and then follows with a Q &amp; A session where you may ask her specifics. It is important to note that she has a policy where she does not tell her customers negative things that she foresees, for she believes that our destinies and futures are constantly changing and that therefore nothing is permanent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can probably guess from the Biblical images, King and her husbands are devoted Catholics. In fact, King believes that fortune telling was “a gift from the mighty good Lord for the purpose of helping people.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince she was a little girl, her mother had noticed she would say things that would somehow coincidentally come true.

Scott Fitzgerald or Facebook’s role in Peru are a whole lot more forgettable than rambunctious outings or late nights with video games and friends.

School is definitely one of the most important things to work at, but as my parting word of wisdom, I just ask you to remember that life will always be about more than securing a future.

Price said the main draw of the boutique is its ability to offer customers access to stylish designer clothing and accessories at affordable prices.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrice explained the extensive effort that went into creating the TCB space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“We came into this space, and it looked totally different,” she said. “We built the dressing rooms ourselves.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Greenville location is the second brick and mortar store of the TCB franchise. Price’s best friend and former college roommate, Anna Grace, began the business with a gutted 1964 Airstream. Price said Grace was able to create a small boutique atmosphere inside the trailer by building a dressing room inside, giving the franchise its name. Once Grace had earned enough by hosting traveling trunk shows with the Airstream, she opened a shop in downtown Southern Pines, N.C.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrace selected Greenville for the location of the second store due to Price’s willingness to join the franchise but also because of the lure of the downtown area. The revitalization effort that has taken place over the past decades has earned national recognition for downtown Greenville and made it into the ideal area in the Upstate for small businesses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“I’ve grown up in Greenville, and I’ve seen how downtown has changed,” Price said. “It’s become what it is today because the mayor has done so much to foster small businesses.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe franchise seeks to support the Greenville and Southern Pines communities by supporting local nonprofits with a monthly outreach event.

If you picked the most magical place on earth as your vacation destination, hit up Epcot for the “country crawl,” in which contestants attempt to consume an alcoholic beverage from each of the eleven tributes to the nations of the world. For other classy vacation destinations, wineries and craft beer breweries offer a nice respite from the busy life of shopping, skiing or beach tanning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClichés aside, Spring Break trips are great to just relax and see some new stuff.

No one is here. For adventure purposes, treat Furman like Hogwarts and explore Judson’s fifth floor or break into the Thoreau Cabin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever you do this break, just enjoy it.

It has been a whirlwind of a year living overseas for the two of us. After numerous scones and pounds of pasta it was time to return to the wonders of the DH. Oh how we have missed you. Our first encounter with the DH was overwhelming to the point of passing out. Crowds of unrecognizable freshmen, extended tables, and the relocation of some of our favorite foods made the DH feel like we were freshman on our first day of school. How does one cope with such a conundrum?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe head to the old standby, the PDen only to find that it is no longer the same. What is the Trone Zone? A new filming location for the next installment of \u003Ci\u003EThe Avengers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E? Sadly no, it is home to cozy leather couches, a classy fireplace made of stones for those frigid afternoons, and a multitude of TVs one would only find in Lebron James’ house. With all these amenities, it is no wonder we cannot find a parking spot in the UC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a somewhat easier semester abroad, heading to the library is the last thing on our list. However, the workload of Furman classes is yet another adjustment we have had to make. On the first day of class we received a 100-page reading assignment, and only after printing said assignment did we become aware of the new printing quota. It looks like we will be spending some Benjamins on our reading assignments. Since when did it cost money to do homework?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently Furman is trying to conserve its paper use and as a result the post office has switched to email notifications in place of the more traditional paper slip. Who would have thought after being abroad for just a semester that the post office would move to the 21st century. It sure makes checking Office 365 a little bit more crazy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough these adjustments have come as a bit of a shock to the two of us, it is always comforting to return to Furman and realize that not much has really changed when you receive the parking ticket from Officer 21.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82b30",name:"F FLU All the Time",slug:"f-flu-all-the-time",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-01-28T05:00:27.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed56d",name:"Jeff Levene",slug:"jeff-levene",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:[],description:"As the son of a cardiologist, one might assume that all my health fears would revolve around overzealous amounts of bacon, drive through windows, and having Paula Dean as a personal chef.",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003EAs the son of a cardiologist, one might assume that all my health fears would revolve around overzealous amounts of bacon, drive through windows, and having Paula Dean as a personal chef. Well you should know that I’m currently munching on some deep fried Sweet and Sour Chicken and am also considering running to Cook Out for a Reese cup milkshake as a reward for finishing this article. No, my worst medical nightmare isn’t triggered with the thought of maxing out my cholesterol or being reduced to a motorized wheelchair (thank you outrageously overactive metabolism) but instead the subtle hint of a cough or sneeze. Well, more the subtle hint of a cough or sneeze during one of America’s toughest flu seasons. The flu, stomach bugs, common colds, or even just basic feelings of unpleasantness are hard enough to deal with when you can stay home and sleep it off. But throw in excessive interactions with other infected students through classes, intramurals, or hugs at rush events and those brief nose tickles and a froggy throat can lead to a campus wide epidemic of viral destruction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt’s always frustrating when that random person shows up in class with a saturated hankie and death in their eyes. Classrooms definitely can count as biological bacteria study environments during flu season. I felt like an unfortunate test subject last week then when my history professor came into class, bubbly as always, bragging about how she had what she described as “the plague” all weekend. Her curly spunky hair and sassy attitude about the French Revolution couldn’t distract me away from the swelling red around her nose and what brief moments of insanity that seemed even crazier than usual. I cringed, realizing I had chosen to sit in the front row, and held my breath for minutes at a time whenever she meandered over to my section of the classroom. Next class the bug had jumped the front row to the seat behind me , and I felt several sneeze sprays grace the back of my neck.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it, as of now I think all of my professors are sick. In Immersion Journalism, the rich sound of Dr. Tevis’ reading voice was clogged with stuffiness. Her recitation of a passage from \u003Ci\u003EThe English Patient \u003C\u002Fi\u003Esounded more like a Kermit the Frog broadcast than a poetic reading by Garrison Keiller. Italian Film followed suit with Dr. Letteri’s harsher than normal New Yorker raspiness reminding me that not only does the film \u003Ci\u003EBicycle Thieves \u003C\u002Fi\u003Ereflect an overall failure of Italian culture to help the workingman but also that disease is currently everywhere.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile in public I can garner myself with hand sanitizer and a gas mask, I feel utterly vulnerable to infection when a roommate falls ill. This weekend my next door neighbor stopped by to borrow a phone, his plea coming from a gunky throat that had changed his unusually manly voice into one I would instead identify as the voice of someone named Eugene. Cringing, I obliged him, looking into my liquor cabinet, questioning whether scrubbing tequila on my phone would work the same as rubbing alcohol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ironic truth is I have no right to take such precautions with other people’s illness because I rarely take them when I myself fall victim. I’ll shamelessly touch the TV remote, the Xbox controller and the Wii nun chuck without washing my hands. I’ll blow my nose without fear of reprisal even though my father often calls the noise a “foghorn solo”. The honest truth is I’m probably getting sick as I write this. Sure I can give you tips on ways to stay healthy and combat a trip to the infirmary. But, sometimes you just get screwed by the flu. You can do everything right and your immune system will still putter out. So why avoid the inevitable. I’ve personally decided that rather than worry about how I’ll have walk to class in feverish conditions, I may just hit up some OJ to get vitamin C. Maybe I’ll add a shot of the tequila mentioned above for luck. As FX spy Archer once stated, “alcohol is what they sterilize hospitals with.” May as well give it a shot.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"}],totalDocs:463,limit:25,page:17,totalPages:19,nextPage:18,prevPage:16,hasPrevPage:true,hasNextPage:true},pageTitle:"Diversions"},uses:{params:["category","page"],url:1}}],
