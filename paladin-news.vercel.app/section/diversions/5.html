Constant travel forces one to sit and think; one can lean her head against the cold coach window and ponder the subtleties of life. During my hours of highbrow introspection, I finally came to a solemn conclusion: the junk food over here is \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Emad delicious.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E Hold your applause, as well as your shock and betrayal. I am not saying that European junk foods are better than the ones we have back in the U.S., but these foods are, shall we say, levelled up. Firstly, their use of puff pastry is superb. The British invented something called a sausage roll, which is basically crumbly sausage filling encased in a flaky pastry shell. If your mouth is not watering, I do not know what to tell you. Sausage rolls are comically delicious. I tried one for the first time back in Stratford-upon-Avon, and I still have not recovered from the ecstasy.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E I found another greasy snack at some hole-in-the-wall in Galway, Ireland (disclaimer for those who don't already know: Ireland is NOT TECHNICALLY part of the British Isles. The Irish would be mad at me if I failed to mention this distinction.) Anyway, the snack was called a \"choco stick,\" and it was essentially a one-inch-wide, foot-long Starbucks chocolate croissant. (What? Yeah. You heard right.) Seriously, this thing was twelve inches long, and that is a conservative estimate. I felt weird eating it. Tell me where I can find a choco stick in the United States and I will be sorely impressed.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E The third critical snack item was a brand of chips called Tayto, complete with a potato mascot who looks like an off-brand Mr. Peanut. Tayto is a huge Irish corporation, and these people love Tayto. Mr. Tayto himself even offers tours of the Tayto factory. (For some reason, this rubs me the wrong way. I feel like Mr. Tayto is an even more vindictive version of Willy Wonka. Also, he is a potato. But I digress.) While I was in Ireland, I tried three different flavors of Tayto, and I cannot lie: they tasted exactly the same as American potato chips. But hey – does Frito Lay have an uncanny humanoid potato to boost sales? I think not. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EMy last and most shocking junk food discovery is this: American ice cream is not top-tier.

This is my first time visiting Europe, and I'm loving all of it – the architecture, the history, and the different slang (who says \"queue\" instead of \"line\"? British people.) The 20 of us have bopped around Stratford and Galway, seen a bunch of great theater performances, and eaten pounds of scones with clotted cream (which is apparently just half-churned butter. Mmm.) Overall, incredible stuff.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E Here's the thing, though: Americans are obnoxious. I mean, seriously obnoxious. Our international reputation is well-earned. We cannot seem to help it: we generate noise, and at times, we radiate incompetency. Studying in the U.K. is like letting a group of children run wild in a large and gloomy Chuck E. Cheese’s. There's so much to see, everyone's tired, and we cannot shut up.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E I have learned two things about Americans during these first few weeks abroad. First of all, we are the only ones who want to split the check at restaurants. Splitting the check is not the norm here at all – here, when friends go out for dinner, they just take turns footing the tab. And, when our group goes out to eat, even in groups of three or four, we almost always have to ask for split checks – at which point I can literally see the patience drain from our waiter's face. It is amazing. Most people pay with cash here, too. I try to blend in and pay cash most of the time, but sometimes I don't carry a bunch of cold hard Euros, at which point I shamefully resort to my debit card. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E The second thing about Americans is this – we are insanely loud. So much louder than I thought possible. When our group enters any given space, be it a café or a Neolithic burial ground, the noise level goes up by a factor of 200. I've seen locals cringe. Most Europeans seem to have mastered the art of the inside voice; our group clearly has not, but I have high hopes for the next few months. I talk pretty quietly when we are out and about, but my accent still sounds stark next to the British and Irish voices. I always thought of American English as the default English sound, but it turns out that my accent sounds as unusual over here as a British accent sounds in the United States. Weird.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E Oddly, I've bumped into a few folks from the U.S. while I have been in Ireland. Usually they hear a familiar accent, turn around, and ask where I am from. Then they want to talk about Hurricane Irma. I have talked to about five random Americans so far, and we all seem to share a strange camaraderie. Maybe it is because we all know that we are out of place. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E That's what I love the most about being abroad, though. Everything is unfamiliar to me, and I get to learn how it all works – mostly by messing up again and again until I do something correct. When I do dumb American things, it reminds me that staying in a host country is a privilege, not a right. I do not belong here yet, and that's okay.

Armed with cameras and instrumentation, Voyager’s arrival allowed scientists to study everything they could find in the short time it would be near the planet. For the first time in history, the swirling, red storm known as the Great Red Spot was seen up close and personal, and a ring system was discovered around Jupiter. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E For co-investigator Alan Cummings, the big discovery was the stunning variety of moons around Jupiter. “All that orange and black on Io changed our thinking about the moons in the solar system.

But, wow, how wrong was that!” said Cummings.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E For Dr. David Moffett, physics professor here at Furman, these images “rekindled my love of astronomy and of science in high school.” Voyager had discovered volcanoes outside Earth on Io, and showed that water might exist below Europa’s icy surface. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E The next year, Voyager reached the ringed world of Saturn. Despite its calm appearance - Voyager discovered the presence of winds exceeding 1,000 mph. NASA scientists moved the intrepid space traveler into orbit around one of the moons of Saturn, Titan. Titan is the only moon in the solar system to have an extensive atmosphere. Although Voyager’s cameras could not penetrate the thick layers, it did detect hydrocarbons like methane, a key ingredient for life. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E On its way out of the solar system, Carl Sagan convinced NASA to point Voyager’s camera back towards the inner solar system for one last look at this place that we all call home. In those pictures was one image that Carl Sagan called “The Pale Blue Dot.” He waxed poetically about what that image means and I highly suggest you look up his moving words. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E Nowadays, Voyager 1 is nowhere near the Sun.

Cassini has been in orbit around Saturn since 2004, and has only enriched the knowledge we gained from Voyager. Whereas Voyager only glimpsed at the icy moon Enceladus, Cassini showed that it is still geologically active with ice geysers (called cryovolcanoes) erupting all the time. Cassini has also pierced the veil on Titan, landing the Huygens probe on the surface. There it found a hazy sky, the color of twilight.

Its cameras are taking detailed pictures of Saturn’s atmosphere in attempt to figure out what makes Saturn tick. Since Enceladus and Titan could possibly have ingredients for life on them, at 6:31 AM EDT, NASA will command Cassini to dive into Saturn’s atmosphere, collecting data until data can no longer be collected.

Author Megan Gustashaw’s shock was evident, and understandable. The Aloha Shirt (For that is what they call the garment in Hawaii. You know the old joke about what they call Chinese food in China? Same idea.) had long been consigned to the back of your Grandpa’s closet, a tacky bit of fashion flotsam against whom cool had been granted a permanent restraining order. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E But then something weird happened. Some hip young teenyboppers decided that bright colors and tropical patterns were pretty cool, and before you could say “fashion is fickle,” trendy celebrities and unsmiling runway models everywhere were trading their starchy button-downs for the silky soft comfort of the Islands.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E I couldn’t have been happier. You see, I had long counted myself among the true believers, we who mourned the Aloha Shirt’s undeserved fall from grace. For years, we looked in vain for a return to the enlightened age of yesteryear, when the thought of floral prints evoked mustachioed private investigators who drove Ferraris and bantered with fussy British Majordomos. It was a beautiful dream, but one that I feared would never come true. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E It has, dear readers, it has.

Favored in tropical climates, the collar is identified by its low profile—it doesn’t stand up against the neck, but lays flat around it—and the way it extends downward to include the shirt front. This creates the appearance of tiny “lapels,” and makes it so that the highest button you could possibly fasten is at least one position lower than that of a shirt with a standard collar. This frees up the neck and allows air to circulate through the shirt much more readily. Heat doesn’t stand a chance. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E No buts about this one.

All three are equally well-suited to tropical climates and wear well. The question of which material is best for you is purely a matter of personal taste. Cotton is the thickest of the three, making for a heavier but more structured shirt. Silk has a certain sheen that appeals to many. Rayon is the lightest of the fabrics, and the most common. The choice is up to you.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E Fit is a tricky thing with Aloha Shirts. They are meant to be somewhat loose so that air can circulate in and out. One of the unfortunate legacies of the “ugly vacation shirt” epoch, however, is that many wanna-be Aloha Shirts are cut like parachutes, and thus aren’t flattering in any way whatsoever. Avoid these like the plague. Try for a shirt that’s just a bit looser than a formal button-down. Put another way: if you can’t bowl, the shirt’s too tight. If the sleeves reach down to your elbows, it’s too loose. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat It’s All About: Choosing the Right Print\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E An Aloha Shirt’s print is its most distinct and—from an enthusiast’s perspective—most glorious feature. It is what gets the shirt—and you—noticed. Pattern-wise, the sky’s the limit. If you want a shirt depicting Susan B. Anthony fighting a Velociraptor, follow your heart, man. A word of advice, though: be mindful of the shirt’s colors. Do they complement one another? Do they look good on you?

Blake was on a boat in Lake Murray in Lexington, SC. According to Blake, the lake was packed with boats filled with excited families awaiting the event. As the sun began to rotate slowly behind the moon, the weather dropped from 90F to an almost chilly 70F. The sun crept towards totality and the lake became still. Boat engines turned off, birds flew above in packs, crickets and other nighttime insects began to chirp. The sun hid behind the moon and emerged like a spotlight two and a half minutes later, and boats revved their engines and sped across the lake in the newly discovered light of day.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E Blake said, “It was the coolest thing I’ve ever experienced.” \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMetairie, LA\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E In a suburb in Louisiana fifteen minutes from downtown New Orleans, the Brignac family gathered at their home.

The film revolves around Mary and her uncle (Chris Evans). Mary is a brilliant first grader whose life may be uprooted when her estranged grandmother wants to take custody and place her in a school for advanced kids. Despite a potentially cliché premise, director Marc Webb (“500 Days of Summer”) elevates the material to make an enjoyable, thoughtful entry into the ‘kid genius’ subgenre of Sundance-esque films.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe movie opens with a humorous back-and-forth over breakfast between Mary and her uncle, Frank, on the first day of school. Mary is resistant, insisting that she would be better off by just staying home because there’s nothing that school can teach her. But Frank won’t hear any of it, and declares that she needs to do things that normal kids do, which means going to school and making friends. This debate shapes the rest of the film, especially when Mary’s grandmother appears and attempts to take her back to Boston and follow in the footsteps of her mother, a math prodigy who committed suicide shortly after Mary’s birth. Naturally, this all leads to an emotional conflict that makes its way to the courtroom, with impassioned arguments from both sides.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf what I am describing sounds like the plot of a midday Lifetime movie, that’s because it kind of is one. But what makes this movie so impressive is that it constantly avoids ever feeling like it. Instead of falling into drippy, obvious plot beats, it instead is loaded with engaging dialogue, layered plots, recurring jokes and a special one-eyed cat named Fred that repeatedly steals the show. Every scene is endearing, not in a manipulative way, but in an honest, empathetic way, where you really feel for each of these people. There is no clear bad guy or any right or wrong answers, just different opinions and methods on how to raise an especially gifted child. These differing perspectives are both convincing, and through humor and bitterness, they will be argued until the end. By that end, this movie stands on its own merits aside from the rest of its genre. It’s enjoyable, satisfying and occasionally very funny. While it may not contain any grand revelations or groundbreaking original storytelling, it is different enough from the common fare to make a worthwhile trip to the theater. Even if it may be a 3-star movie on its own, it’s a 3.5 for me due to how different it is from everything else out currently.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBONUS POINTS\u003C\u002Fb\u003E: The grandmother referring to her rich ex-husband who has gone to live in the plains as “The Man Who Shot Liberty Mutual.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENEGATIVE POINTS\u003C\u002Fb\u003E: I know that I’m in the minority here, but I could do without Jenny Slate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E3.5 out of 5 Stars\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f30",name:"Bon Appétit: A Success or Not?",slug:"bon-appetit-a-success-or-not",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-04-27T20:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["catherinemclaughlin","issue14"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Catherine McLaughlin\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the spring semester of 2016, Furman ended its 19-year contract with Aramark, replacing the dining service with Bon Appétit.

Fellow sophomore Robbie Grecco agreed and said that the Dining Hall has an overall lack of variety.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother complaint which many students have is the limited dining hours, especially on weekends. “They definitely need to make some changes to have better hours,” Cianci said. “I think Bon Appétit also needs to put a 24-hour food place on campus even if it’s something super small and simple.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the Dining Hall, Bon Appétit has brought other new changes to Furman’s dining scene. It replaced the Paddock with a Tupelo Honey Café, turned Southern Pressed Juicery in the PalaDen into Grinders Sandwiches and recently unveiled plans to create a library café opening in the fall of 2017.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough some students miss Southern Pressed Juicery’s smoothies and energy bowls, a lot of students are happy with the PalaDen changes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“I love the new sandwich place in the PDen,” said sophomore Rish Agarwal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECianci also said that she likes Grinders sandwiches, and generally goes there more often for meals than she did for Southern Pressed Juicery last year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“The old Paddock is definitely a lot better now that it is Tupelo Honey,” Cianci said.

We had met before, in tedious English classes and insufferable Baz Luhrmann films, but he’d looked old then, out of touch and out of time, a fading icon whose best days had passed him by. That evening, however, with the Furman Theatre’s triumphant production of “Romeo and Juliet,” The Bard was in no mood to phone it in. He took back the stage with a vengeance, and held it with the white-hot intensity of a young man with something to prove, who wouldn’t be satisfied until he’d laid himself bare beneath the glaring spotlight.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is Shakespeare the way he was meant to be experienced: prescient, entertaining and supremely affecting. I cannot heap enough praise upon the company for its incredible achievement. All involved have clearly given their best effort, and the high caliber of each department’s creative contribution showed up in every superbly crafted moment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECo-Directors Maegan and Thomas Azar have re-imagined Shakespeare’s Verona as a latter-day war zone — some ungodly mixture of Syria, Bosnia, and Nazi Germany — re-casting the Montagues and Capulets as warlords whose fighting threatens to tear what’s left of the city apart. Alan Bryson’s set looks like the bombed-out palace of some third-world dictator, populated by characters clad in military uniforms, leather dusters and combat boots, who run in and out of the story brandishing frightfully realistic machine guns. Paradoxically, turning Verona into a city of extremes had a way of normalizing the proceedings; this is the kind of place where love is worth dying — and killing — for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking their cues from this idea, Lighting Designer Taylor Jensen and Sound Designer Lauren Girouard have both done an excellent job of keeping tensions and passions high. Strobe effects add punch to the show’s moments of hand-to-hand combat, perfectly complementing Thomas Azar’s cinematic fight choreography, and lighting is responsible for many of the gorgeous and powerful stage images scattered throughout. I was floored by an incredible moment when a back-lit Romeo steps between two of the set’s columns and turns into a stoic silhouette, his outline and that of his firearm set stark and pitch-black against the pale brightness. The music, meanwhile, works to up the contrast between the frenzied terror of the play’s conflict and the quiet, tender moments of Romeo and Juliet’s courtship. Wistful, romantic melodies underscore the fleeting moments of peace our hero and heroine share together, before being rudely interrupted by the screaming guitars and pounding drums that characterize the disorienting world around them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these triumphs of design provide an incredible theatrical landscape for the actors, who inhabit it fully and fearlessly. Any production of “Romeo and Juliet” lives or dies by the performances of the actors playing the titular characters, and here the production absolutely thrives. Drake Shadwell’s Romeo is a livewire start to finish. He does an excellent job setting up Romeo’s ultimate fate as something of an inevitability, playing the character like so many of the angry young men whose uncontrollable passions took them from the world too soon. Likewise, Dayanari Umana’s Juliet exudes tenacity and humanity. Before this production, it hadn’t occurred to me how fully Juliet drives the play’s narrative, but Umana’s performance emphasizes the character’s wit and resilience. Juliet is the play’s great problem-solver, willing to be flirtatious, violent and submissive if it serves her ends, always looking to untangle herself from the web of other people’s interests that threatens to trap her forever.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are great performances to be found everywhere, though. The entire cast has done a marvelous job bringing Shakespeare’s words to life. No glorified poetry recitation is this. The actors dig deep in search of the emotional bedrock underpinning every line, finding the humor, hatred and heartache that elevate Shakespeare’s words from emulsified couplets to peerless reflections upon the human soul. Nothing sounds stilted or artificial (Well, almost nothing: at the moment of his death, Cody Evins’ Paris is made to recite the one Shakespeare line that you really cannot do a darn thing with: “I am slain.”).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis show was for everyone who’s ever had to struggle through a print copy of “Romeo and Juliet,” trying not to drown in a sea of words that are often beautiful and clever, but nigh impossible to find relatable without the transformative medium of performance. If you’ve ever wondered of Shakespeare and his work, “What was this guy trying to say and why do people still care?”, it is productions like this that provide the best answer, because they make it seem that The Bard is there, in the theatre, telling you himself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f2e",name:"Wallin the Animal Woman: A Discussion with Greenville Humane Society Education Director",slug:"wallin-the-animal-woman-a-discussion-with-greenville-humane-society-education-director",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-04-27T20:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["ellepeavy","issue14"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Elle Peavy, Contributor\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small room.

She has been drawn to animals for as long as she can remember.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“I had a salamander. I had a turtle. And I had a rabbit for at least six years,” Wallin listed. “Oh, I had gerbils. I raised gerbils and sold them to the pet store.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer explanation for such a group of animals? She claimed that they always found her. Wallin admitted that this love for animals was not hereditary. Regarding her family’s appreciation for animals, she simply stated: “I do not think they fostered [a love for them]. They were tolerant of animals, but I was definitely the biggest animal lover in the family.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“My father used to make me flush my [live] fish down the toilet. Because it would be time to go on vacation and we wouldn’t have anyone to take care for the fish,” she said, “I thought that was an incredibly calloused part of my father.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWallin revisited different past events that she claimed were “memories [that] are deeply etched in my psyche.” She also recalled a time when she found her escaped Salamander under her bed in a shriveled state.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile conveying these memories, which she described as traumatizing, she stopped to take notice that the dog in the room, which she referred to as Chance, was licking an empty water bowl. “I should give you some water, sweetheart,” she said. She then quickly uncapped the bottle of water on her desk, which she had been periodically sipping due to her sore throat and poured half of its contents into the dog’s water bowl.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChance is one of Wallin’s latest projects, which “They [Humane Society animal management] really do not encourage,” Wallin said. Chance’s vague resemblance of a Pitbull and his predominantly black coat were two traits buyers tend to avoid, therefore she often gave him extra attention, she explained.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWallin was raised in New Jersey. She attended Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, and got her first job in New York City, as a Sales Marketing and Customer Service Trainer. Then she moved to Philadelphia for a similar job opportunity. Once she was in her forties and settled in South Carolina, she received her Master’s in Education. Yet, it was not until she had her third child that she was settled enough to start caring for animals again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“We had a Labrador Retriever – love of our lives – for 12 years,” she said. In addition, the Wallin family rescued a tiny dog that has “ended up being the bane of everyone’s existence,” she said with an eye roll and a smile. The last dog she rescued from her son’s fraternity house. Wallin took the dog to the doctor and spent $1000 on her recovery. When her son asked for the dog back Wallin replied, “Well, if you have $1000 maybe we can talk.” She added that “he went to Best Buy and bought a tv instead.” Wallin still has the dog, Sam, four years later.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Humane Society Education department is a one-person department. Wallin has built this department from the ground up by manufacturing various lesson plans, and getting them piloted in, whilst forming relationships with various public schools and community centers. She has also recruited Furman University’s students to help with her programs. As the Education Department head, her job is to educate children of various ages, about the importance of proper animal care. She had 42 school visits scheduled in February and March alone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWallin said, in regards to the public school visits, “We felt that given the population we were addressing that it was important that they were educated, because a lot of them don’t have very positive role models for how to handle dogs and cats properly.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWallin’s goal for the department was to incorporate as many school as possible into her repertoire. She also wanted to expand the number of programs by bringing classes to the Humane Society and starting a summer camp. “We are on the up and up,” said Wallin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“This job has really fueled my interest in animal welfare issues, because I hear so much from customers and the people I teach about how little they know and about how little money they are willing to spend and how easily they are able to surrender their pet if it is inconvenient.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWallin gave an eyewitness account of one man driving by the Humane Society, letting his dog jump out of the car and then driving away all because he wanted to avoid paying the 25-dollar surrender fee. “I just do not have a whole lot of patience for people,” she commented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWallin also spoke of a college student, who adopted a puppy last year due to medical reasons. The police found the few-months-old puppy tied to a porch one evening, shortly after the student adopted him. Some of the student’s hallmates approached Wallin trying to convince her to confiscate the dog due to maltreatment. Wallin told the hallmates that she was not legally able to take the dog without any physical evidence of harm being done.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“In France, dogs are considered a life worth protecting. In the United States they are still considered personal property,” she said, with her shoulders visibly sagging for a moment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChance, the dog, then paced throughout the room, knocked stacks of paper off the table and then relieved himself on the floor. Wallin responded slowly. She re-stacked the papers, cleaned the mess and placed the pup on her lap to cuddle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“We must always remember how much the voiceless need us to be their advocates,” Wallin said, smiling while cradling Chance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f2d",name:"Nine Movies to Watch Before you Graduate College",slug:"nine-movies-to-watch-before-you-graduate-college",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-04-27T20:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["issue14","scottharvey"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Scott Harvey, Columnist\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you read this, I will be about one week away from graduating from Furman.

Ryder is a well-acted and likeable underdog thrust into the role of Pathfinder, leader of the human arc responsible for exploring future home worlds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003EThis adventure is much more than exploration, and combat becomes the game’s most notable selling point. “Andromeda’s” combat is energetic, fast-paced and mobile. The new combat system is complimented by a flexible set of skill trees, which challenge traditional class-based RPGs. The player can pick from a variety of skills under the categories of tech, biotic and combat. Though players can only equip three skills at a time, they can change configuration and class profile in combat after a brief cooldown. This sandbox approach to character-building and tactics offers a new and refreshing facelift to “Mass Effect’s” combat system.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003EThe graphics in “Andromeda” are next generation, using the Frostbite 3 engine’s breathtaking ability to render dangerous, colorful worlds in vivid detail.

While BioWare has certainly made mistakes in how they handle minority characters, the developers have frequently attempted to reconcile these misrepresentations, and the attempt at inclusivity alone is more than can be said of most companies in the video game industry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003EMultiple racial backgrounds are well represented on Ryder’s ship, the Tempest, and its crew make up some of Ryder’s closest companions. Characters carry much of the story content, and some of my best moments so far have been when engaging with “Andromeda’s” new cast. With vast personalities and sexualities, BioWare offers an inclusive, diverse set of companions to accompany Ryder on her journey across the galaxy. While BioWare has always been relatively inclusive with its romance options, the disproportionate number of lesbian romance options over gay options speaks to the fetishizing of lesbians and BioWare’s tendency to cater to its straight male player-base, despite claims to the contrary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003EBioWare has maintained inclusivity in other areas, however, and I was pleasantly surprised at the number of non-white characters within the game. Many of Ryder’s companions and the non-player characters in the game’s general populous are people of color. Many of the authority figures within the game, from the Arc Hyperion captain to the leader of Ryder’s first colony, are people of color, a feature that is glaringly apparent considering most video games are populated by identical white man soldiers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003EWhile certain areas could use some work, “Andromeda” is a mostly successful installment in the “Mass Effect” series.

April 4. With all classes cancelled, many classroom buildings were desolate for Furman Engaged, but the Roe Art Building was filled to capacity, with hundreds of art lovers flocking to see the Furman seniors’ creations. The gallery opening was an elegant and enjoyable affair with wine, cheese and other hors d'oeuvres served to art connoisseurs in attendance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs indicated by the exhibition’s title, “Passages” features works which illustrate the personal journeys of the senior class of art students during their time at Furman. Each piece was unique and showed the wide range of personalities and experiences of the 14 students over their four years at Furman. Although I did not personally know any of the students whose work is on display, each piece seemed to convey, with a shocking degree of clarity, the individuality of its artist. As visitors to the reception perused the works, many of the artists shared their creative processes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite displays was “Meraki” by artist Candler Reynolds. Reynolds’ display exhibited portraits of her female relatives who have had a large influence on her. She uses majolica (Italian tin-glazed pottery) ceramics to express the strength and communion of the women in her family. Reynolds crafted a beautiful painted table to symbolize the “bond born while participating in the formalities of life and womanhood” such as in cooking and drinking tea together. Reynold’s display also exhibits portraits of her female role models, giving viewers an intimate glimpse into the artist’s life. In ceramic plates arranged on the table, Reynolds offered gallery viewers stickers displaying symbols of each of her relatives, allowing her viewers to participate in her family’s fellowship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother intriguing work was Rowan Griscom’s “Landscapes in Type.” This series of acrylic paintings examined commonplace fonts such as Baskerville, Garamond and Goudy under an artistic lense. Griscom deconstructed and experimented with typography in order to “create work that celebrated the beautiful nuances of a ubiquitous art form.” I appreciated this display because it encouraged me to think about small, seemingly mundane creations as skilled artwork. Each piece in Griscom’s display played with a certain letter in a particular font and color scheme, creating an intriguing multi-dimensional art piece from just a single typographic letter.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the displays were widely varied in both medium and subject, each piece exhibited a brilliant originality and artistic skill indicative of the artist’s exceptional Furman education as well as their inherent talent. I have often wished that I was a talented painter, but despite my artistic ineptitude, I was inspired by the works of the senior student gallery now on display in the Thompson gallery. Students interested in expanding their artistic sensibilities, exercising their cultural appreciation and supporting their artistically gifted peers will have the opportunity to view “Passages” in the Roe Art Building until May 4. The gallery is open weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and the exhibition is free and open to the public.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f1d",name:"Creme Shack: Rolled Ice Cream",slug:"creme-shack-rolled-ice-cream",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-04-14T03:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["catherinemclaughlin","issue12"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Catherine McLaughlin, Columnist\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDowntown Greenville welcomed a new addition to its up and coming food scene on Friday, February 24th with the long-awaited opening of Creme Shack. Located at the former Chocolate Moose on Main Street, Creme Shack hand-crafts and serves the newest dessert trend — rolled ice cream.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreme Shack creates and serves 12 featured creations and also gives customers the liberty to create their own dessert from the 15 base flavors and nearly 40 toppings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe process of making rolled ice cream begins by placing various ingredients on a cold griddle, ranging from negative 15 to negative 25 degrees. Next, freshly made cream is poured on top of the ingredients. This begins a process of chopping ingredients, mixing them into the cream and forming the ice cream with the help of small metal paddles. In order to create five even rolls, the cream is spread evenly across the griddle before it is rolled. This process, which takes two to four minutes, happens at the counter behind glass so that customers can see each of their creations being made.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of rolled ice cream was first created in Thailand by a man who used dry ice and a marble slab to create the treat. His idea was well-received and a year later, Thailand had 1,400 locations serving rolled ice cream. This twist on ice cream has gradually made its way to the United States. Most locations serving the dessert are generally found in large cities with sizable Asian populations. The small city of Greenville is an exception.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreme Shack is owned and operated by Karen and Fred Williams, who have been in the Greenville food industry for more than 30 years. Upon retirement, the couple was in search of their next venture. Their daughter suggested the idea of rolled ice cream. They first tested the idea in a mobile trailer in Panama City Beach, Florida. Their success selling the treat out of the trailer led them to open their own shop in downtown Greenville, just in time for the warmer spring and summer weather.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince its opening, everyone in Greenville has wanted to take part in experiencing this new trend in ice cream.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman student Barrie Clarke praised the shop. “Creme Shack is my new go-to ice cream place!” she said. “It’s definitely taking the place of the frozen yogurt craze.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile rolled ice cream offers a fun, unique spin on the treat, Creme Shack has received mixed reviews. Though its long lines and waits speak to its popularity and success, some customers wonder whether it is worth the wait or the hefty price of nearly eight dollars per order. Greenville will have to see whether this is a temporary fad or a permanent addition to the downtown.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreme Shack is open seven days a week, Monday through Thursday 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday 11:30 a.m.to 11:00 p.m. and Sunday 12:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f1c",name:"Patriotism, Britney Spears, Leather and Anime: A Recap of Furman’s 2017 Drag Show Competition",slug:"patriotism-britney-spears-leather-and-anime-a-recap-of-furmans-2017-drag-show-competition",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-04-14T03:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["andrewtaye","issue12"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Andrew Taye, Staff Writer\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman’s Gay-Straight Alliance group Encouraging Respect of Sexualities (EROS) hosted its annual drag show, Friday March 31. Watkins room was packed with students, faculty and staff all eager to see what drag potential Furman has to offer. The judges, seated directly in front of the catwalk, were also eager to examine the contestants and find this year’s winner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore the competition commenced, education professor Dr. Scott Henderson reminded us that “drag is a form of gender impersonation” and that “gender expression is not the same as gender orientation.” Then Princess Mocha, a professional drag queen and recurring host at Furman’s drag show, entered Watkins gracefully whilst leading the anxious contestants. Here is a narration of the exciting events that took place that evening.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergeant Johnson was the first drag king to perform, wearing a camouflage, military uniform whilst wielding the US flag. With a fierce gaze and strong sense of patriotism, he sang an acapella rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner” and then moved on to hard-hitting tunes such as “Lit ‘Em Up” by Fall Out Boy. He consolidated machismo throughout the performance and therefore provided a solid, conventional male impersonation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second performer went by the exceptional name of Jackie Channel. Dressed in a hot red blouse, a tight black skirt and intense black boots, the drag queen stole audiences with his erogenous aesthetic. Embodying an apathetic and valley-girlesque caricature, he danced to Britney Spears, striking fierce poses as many times as he could. His overt sassiness and movement within the audience area energized viewers as well as garnered many enthusiastic reactions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third act was very unique and unprecedented in Furman’s drag show history as a drag queen and king came onstage to perform a couple’s routine. The couple, characteristically named Sandy and Danny, obviously performed “You’re the One That I Want” from the musical “Grease” and thus won over old-school hearts in the audience. Their fun and very adorable performance was complimented by their movie-appropriate attire which consisted mostly of black leather and groovy wigs. All hands were clapping in sync with the nostalgic rhythm of the performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last contestant to perform, however, also added another unique quality to the drag show. Anime-influenced drag queen Mayumi Miku-chan sported a loud pink dress with a massive blonde wig that showcased long curly pigtails. He danced to a fast-paced Japanese pop song and demonstrated great musicality owing to each gesture he employed for almost every beat represented in the song. He even brought two female students from the audience onstage to join him in his bubbly dance. All of this was done whilst fully lip-syncing in Japanese.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the judges deliberated on the winner, Princess Mocha blessed us with an inspiring performance of the song “Green Light” by Lorde. Mocha’s stunning body suit included silver wings that, when expanded to their fullest capacity, transformed him into a drag queen angel. His professional performance reminded audiences of the limitless capabilities of drag performances.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Mocha had finished gliding through Watkins, the judges were given the opportunity to relay their criticisms to the contestants. The judges applauded Sergeant Johnson for her ability to “personify the male persona excellently,” complimented the fierceness of Jackie Channel’s performance and after calling him “the total package,” truly appreciated the fact that Mayumi Miku-chan had lip synced in a foreign language. However, Sandy and Danny were made the winners of this year’s drag show competition due to their endearing choreography, amazing costumes and heartening rendition of a timeless duet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all, this year’s drag show was an entertaining event that symbolically took place on Transgender Day of Visibility, combating issues of cissexism and transphobia that are very prevalent in today’s society. This annual event also reminds us of the importance of personal expression and the understanding and respect that should follow. I therefore applaud all the contestants for their openness and EROS for creating a platform for genderless freedom.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f1b",name:"\"13 Reasons Why\": A Review",slug:"13-reasons-why-a-review",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-04-14T03:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["issue12","scottharvey"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Scott Harvey, Columnist\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, like me, you were a nerdy kid who grew up in the mid 2000s, you probably read your fair share of YA fiction. And if you read your fair share of YA fiction during that time period, chances are you, one way or another, came across Jay Asher’s 2007 novel “13 Reasons Why.” Asher’s book was a huge hit, both popularly and critically, and for good reason. Its premise was original and its execution was sensitive and wise about a troubling topic. It’s a wonder that it’s taken 10 years for some sort of adaptation to hit screens everywhere.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now that adaptation has arrived in the form of a binge-able, 13 episode Netflix series. I say binge-able because this is one of those shows that sinks its hooks into you from the very beginning and never lets go. Much of this is owed to the fresh and original setup provided by Asher’s novel. “13 Reasons”\u003Ci\u003E \u003C\u002Fi\u003Eis centered on Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a seemingly ordinary high school student, who suddenly and shockingly commits suicide, leaving her community reeling. That community includes Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette from “Don’t Breathe”), who was friends with Hannah and harbored a secret crush on her for a long period of time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Clay and many others are soon in for a shock. As the story begins, Clay receives a package containing a series of tapes. On the tapes, Clay is stunned to discover, is Hannah’s voice. And what Hannah’s voice reveals is that the tapes are her suicide note of sorts, and that the people who have received the tapes each represent one of the reasons why Hannah killed herself, reasons she will explain over each one of the tapes. Gripping stuff, huh?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story flashes between the past, as we see the events which led Hannah to make each tape, and the present, where Clay grapples with his own grief and frustration, all while some of the others on the tapes plot to do whatever it takes to make sure no one finds out about them. The setup may seem a tad gimmicky, but it’s a great gimmick, and executed to suspenseful perfection.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut “13 Reasons Why” isn’t just a compelling mystery. It’s much more than that. Each of Hannah’s tapes raise crucial issues facing both teenagers and adults today. Sexual assault. Alcoholism. Homosexuality. Bullying. They’re all examined in provocative, relevant ways and their treatment makes the show required viewing not just for teens, but for their parents too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that’s “13 Reasons Why”’s greatest contribution. That is, of course, to take nothing away from the supremely talented cast of mostly new faces. Langford is practically transcendent as Hannah. Her presence pervades every scene and her voice burrows its way into your head until you, like Clay, can’t get it out. Familiar faces offer sterling contributions as well, especially Kate Walsh and Brian D’Arcy James as Hannah’s grieving parents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe show’s writing is superlative as well. The teenage characters are all three-dimensional human beings. They aren’t just John Hughes-esque caricatures and, as a result, the journey is a tremendously emotional one. The characters are so vividly realized that you feel all of the highs and lows along with them as, with each tape, the inevitable end grows closer. I can barely remember a film or show which captures the crushing weight of grief and loss so evocatively.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what really makes “13 Reasons Why” so vital is its authenticity. It refuses to pigeonhole teenagers or their problems as somehow less important or less real. In fact, the realization that, by doing just that, they may have indirectly contributed to Hannah’s fate weighs heavily on all of the adult characters in “13 Reasons Why.” “13 Reasons Why” isn’t so much sad as it is angry. It’s a call to action and one that desperately needs to be answered. Following “Bojack Horseman,” and its brilliant dissection of mental illness, Netflix proves again, with “13 Reasons Why,” that it is producing some of the most memorable and important television of our generation. Don’t let this one pass you by.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGrade: A\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f1a",name:"“Plastic China” Documentary Comes to Furman",slug:"plastic-china-documentary-comes-to-furman",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-04-14T03:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["issue12","murphykenefick"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBy Murphy Kenefick, Columnist\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter debuting his film at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, director Jiu-liang Wang brought “Plastic China” to Furman University. Accompanied by a translator, Wang gives a brief introduction of the film and quickly rushes to start it, joking that he is acting as the “projectionist for the evening.” The film revolves around 2 families working in the plastic wasteland of rural China, recycling the various artificial materials to support themselves. The heart of the story is in 11-year-old Yi-Jie, a joyful, resilient young girl whose main dream is to be back in her home city in school. This obviously proves to be difficult as her father is bound to alcoholism, several other children and a strong distrust of the rest of the world. It’s all constructed in a piecemeal fashion with no voiceover narration or direct interviews with the subjects. Instead, the audience gathers information about these people through their daily activities and attitudes toward them. The tone is largely empathetic, putting on display these people who are doing the best with what they have and, for the most part, maintaining an optimistic attitude.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe true power of the film comes in its moments. Watching children excitedly cut out ads for colorful shoes and then cutting sharply to seeing those same children washing their face with murky water elicits the full spectrum of response. The more the film plays out, the more investing it becomes as you feel more hope and more dread for the future of these families. The director’s empathy shines through each scene as we watch these people do activities that are so mundane for them, but so bizarre for us. For example, every day, they sort trash, go looking in massive piles for children’s toys, push sludge through a conveyor belt and wash themselves outside with contaminated water. Each of these images powerfully resonate and leave the lasting impression that Wang intended.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is the constant hope for forward mobility, whether it be for a new car, products ordered over the Internet or the next step in education. Desire for these things no doubt stem from the ads that are discovered from American magazines, displaying the true power of capitalistic marketing. From the plant leader, we hear several speeches on the importance of education because it will inevitably lead to money and success. Whether that ideal is sound or not, it serves as the primary motivator for these people and instills a distant sense of hope.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the discussion held afterwards, director Wang had much to say about the urgency and poignancy of this issue. He described the process of researching the extensive plastics industry and how China has become largely dependent on it. According to him, countries such as the U.S. export their plastic waste to China so that they can process and recycle it. This tough work creates a profit for the citizens, but it is very damaging to the environment. This point comes across in the film as we see the unsanitary squalor that the families live in.

James Mangold, director of the previous lackluster stand-alone Wolverine film, returns to conclude the series in a Western-style story that subverts the usual tone and plot points of related films. Going with a first-time R-rating, an isolated setting and a minimal amount of characters, “Logan” makes a 180 from the oversaturation of superhero films and instead channels the classic Western genre to make a gruff and gritty farewell to one of Marvel’s most famous characters. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThe film opens with the eponymous Logan waking up in the back of his own limo, disturbed by a gang attempting to rob the car. He’s older, possibly drunk, clearly exhausted and really not in the mood for a fight. When pushed to his limit, however, he does so anyway, and ends up in a fight that’s very different from what we’ve seen before. He gets knocked to the ground by these four criminals, shot even, and for a while, he might actually have to walk away defeated. But then, they make him angry, and in classic Wolverine behavior, he launches into his rehearsed fighting motions and ends up tearing the guys apart. We see him at his lowest right off the bat, his new normal, and it’s just the beginning. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EWe now find that in classic Western lore, he’s an outlaw, living a life of solitude. His only interactions are with Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), whose illness has started to cause him to have severe seizures which can, in essence, freeze time. To combat this, Wolverine and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) have a strict regimen of medicines that Charles is ultimately resistant to. This is the bleak world Mangold puts us into, for once focusing on the character primarily as a human being as opposed to a superhero; a caretaker, a makeshift-son, a man, as opposed to a product of a comic book. This approach was largely effective, causing me to care more about the character than I ever have before. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThe real catalyst comes later in the form of a silent little girl who tears apart an entire brigade of militia men trying to capture her. Wolverine and Professor X are caught up in the action, and without giving away too many of the surprises of the plot, they all develop a connection. It functions as a Western, a road movie and, by the end, a superhero action film that feels more grounded in reality than anything since “The Dark Knight.” While it doesn’t have the same complexities and the pacing can lag at times, “Logan” consistently wears its heart on its sleeve, despite being about gruff, vicious people. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EUltimately, “Logan” is more impressive than it is enjoyable, but it serves as a necessarily sturdy final entry in the Wolverine story.

Hardly a vital component of my reading experience. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs far as my seven-year-old self was concerned, anyone\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Ecould have written “Charlotte’s Web.” Dr. Seuss, though, he was something else entirely. I didn’t know E.B. White from J.D. Salinger, but I could spot Seuss a mile away. His prose was unmistakable: immaculately constructed rhyming couplets, replete with words guaranteed to be found nowhere else in English literature. Then there were his no-less-eccentric illustrations. You’d know a Geisel drawing the moment you saw it. His characters are a triumph of purposeful caricature, their features perfectly calibrated to reflect their personalities. The places they inhabit and the objects with which they interact are ridiculously intricate, yet inviting and pleasant to look at. There is not a straight line to be found. Everything droops: the peak of Mt. Krumpet, Horton’s clover, the Lorax’s whiskers; and yet, Geisel’s illustrations are remarkably kinetic. He could suggest movement better than just about any still cartoonist. And the color: reds, yellows and blues so vivid they look like they might rub off on your fingers.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAccording to the exhibit, Geisel was influenced by the Surrealist movement of the early 20\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Eth\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E century, but his images don’t reject reality so much as exaggerate it. I was particularly fond of an illustration Geisel did in the 1930s, entitled “The Copy Writer,” a vivid and bitter portrait of the life of an ad man. The exhausted professional lays prostrate, a coat rack holding him up by his suspenders so that he can reach his typewriter, his emaciated gaze turned upward toward his two sources of inspiration: a bust of Shakespeare and a can of beans. Geisel knew this life well; he spent most of his pre-war career creating advertisements for other people’s products. (His most famous? An illustration and slogan for FLIT insect repellent, displayed at the exhibition: as a swarm of Seussian mosquitoes descend upon their next victim, the prepared outdoorsman calls to his companion: “Quick, Henry, the FLIT!”)\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“The Art of Dr. Seuss” is loaded with other such gems, each one adding a new dimension to Geisel’s life and artistry. Works-in-progress and original prints from his children’s books are on display. His more adult work is showcased as well. Some is charming, gentle satire: Geisel put his experience drawing cartoon birds to good use in a set of prints parodying New York society ladies in the 1960s; their beaks, like the noses of the aristocracy, are turned ever skyward. Some are downright shocking. If you weren’t aware that Geisel was a political cartoonist during the Second World War, seeing Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin drawn in his signature style will be a truly otherworldly experience.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs it happened, one of the items exhibited answered my question with a resounding “yes.” Even now in this, my twenty-second trip around the sun, Dr. Seuss had something yet to teach me. It came, as you might expect, in the form of a poem, delivered by Geisel in a 1977 commencement address. It’s a short piece, but one that offers indispensable advice as only he could, with comedy and clarity:\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“My Uncle Terwilliger on the Art of Eating Popovers”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EMy uncle ordered popovers\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EFrom the restaurant’s bill of fare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAnd when they were served, he regarded them\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EWith a penetrating stare…\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThen he spoke great words of wisdom\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs he sat there in that chair.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“To eat these things,” said my uncle,\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“You must exercise great care.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EYou may swallow down what’s solid\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EBUT… you must spit out the air.”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAnd…as you partake of the world’s bill of\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EFare,\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EThat’s darned good advice to follow:\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EDo a lot of spitting out the hot air\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAnd be careful what you swallow.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003E“The Art of Dr. Seuss” exhibition may be seen at the Upcountry History Museum through May 21, 2017. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f02",name:"“Love” Season 2 Review",slug:"love-season-2-review",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-03-24T03:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97745bc989e23628ee218",name:"Murphy Kenefick",slug:"murphy-kenefick",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["issue11","murphykenefick"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAt this point in the streaming business, Netflix is working its way towards a monopoly. There seems to be a new season or series of original content every week—so much so that it’s almost impossible to consume it all. But last year, when Judd Apatow (“Knocked Up,” “Trainwreck”) debuted the first season of “Love” right after Valentine’s Day, I was immediately interested. The show revolves around Mickey and Gus, two individuals so messy that they’re only bound to make an even bigger one with each other. The first season deals with their separate lives more than their relationship, presenting an interesting deviation from the typical romantic comedy fare. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EBut after the somewhat-cliffhanger of the season one finale, “Love” is back a year later with 12 episodes as opposed to the previous 10. At first, I was excited to learn that there was going to be more content this year, but then as the show got going, I realized that this was a poor choice. The show presents a very casual look at relationships and life in general, featuring a huge ensemble cast, a multitude of minor comedic situations, and the occasional moment of love itself. With this longer season, instead of fleshing out new storylines, it often took more time to meander and rely on previously established characters and jokes. Even if these recurring things are funny, i.e. making theme songs for movies, arguing with neighbors and texting miscommunications, the real heart of the show isn’t as present as usual. The adjustment back into the world of the show takes much longer than it should, and only a real fan of the first season (like myself) would have patience for it. But, in this day and age, it doesn’t take a lot of effort to sit back and let the next episode begin.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EIt isn’t until episode seven that the entire series makes a sharp turn for the better. The frivolous, introductory stories take a backseat and we’re finally able to really focus on the subjects that actually matter in the way that they were presented in the first season. We see the harsh realities of Mickey’s alcoholism, Gus’ co-dependence and various other issues that resonate. If what I described doesn’t really sound like a fun comedy, well…that’s the magic of the latter half of this season. Somehow, the writers manage to make each of those topics accessible and lace them with enough humor to make them enjoyable as well. The characters are empathetic, never irritating, and it’s through these difficult subjects that we get to know them even better.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EBy the end, I only want to participate more in the banal, yet bizarre, lives of the two central characters, along with the dozens of supporting ones that have cemented themselves into the story. It’s all endearing, entertaining and ultimately optimistic despite the plethora of obstacles the two have to overcome. If you’re looking for your next worthwhile, easy-going, well-written Netflix original, I would recommend “Love,” especially for the last few episodes. Knowing Netflix’s new accelerated rate of production, this show is likely to continue for a while, and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779fc9f3871ce8f82f01",name:"Music Major Profile",slug:"music-major-profile",timestamps:{published_at:"2017-03-24T03:57:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97747bc989e23628ee65f",name:"Gabe Troiano",slug:"gabe-troiano",photo:null}]},categories:["diversions"],tags:["gabetroiano","issue11"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003EFurman University faculty, staff and students who are involved in the music department pride themselves in having a rigorous schedule, excellence towards performing, and devotion towards individual or ensemble goals.
