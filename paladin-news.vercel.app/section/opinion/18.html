All of us have seen it as freshmen. Some of us have participated in it as upperclassmen, athletes, or international students. This year, I experienced this infamous process as an upperclassmen RA. Before freshman move-in day, the whole campus trembles with anticipation. As an upperclassmen RA, however, this excitement comes not from the actual move-in, but from seeing how excited the freshmen are for orientation and the start of the school year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EBy the time both upperclassmen and freshmen move in, residence life staff have been on campus for over two weeks, preparing RAs and FRADs for all the duties and responsibilities that comes with being a part of hall staff.

Feeling unsure my newfound RA responsibilities, yet comfortable as an upperclassman, I found that my feelings perfectly complemented my familiarity with Furman’s campus and my happy reunions with old friends. Perhaps move-in day is a the epitome of an upperclassman’s transition and the kick-off event for an RA, symbolizing the responsibilities and excitement in store for them during the rest of the year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82cec",name:"Students Sound Off About Moving In: Senior Laments Lost Check-In Location",slug:"students-sound-off-about-moving-in-senior-laments-lost-check-in-location",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["movingin","senior"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EIt is that time of year again when the car is loaded and I drive nine hours down from Maryland to Greenville, SC. As a senior, this process has become routine. I know exactly what I need and how to do to get ready for Furman again before classes start. Nevertheless, one thing remains different every year: the initial check in process for returning students at Furman.My freshman year, the check-in process was with my RA in the dorms on the same floor. It was simple and easy: I checked in with my RA, signed the room assignment sheet, and got my keys. As a sophomore, instead of a direct check in with my RA, I had to seek out the RA office. Come junior year, I had to go to Estridge Commons in order to check in to my apartment. I went through the same process, signing in with an RA and getting my keys, but I ended up in a different location since I had moved across campus to North Village.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EComing in as a senior, I knew the process of having to sign a piece of paper in exchange for my keys, but I still had one big resounding question: Where should I go? Having gone to J to return my keys at the end of my junior year, I did not know whether the check-in process would happen in Estridge or in Apartment J. I was moving in for the fourth time, and yet I did not feel like a senior. I did not feel as if I had gone to this university for three years already. Instead, I felt lost and confused.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EGiven that the beginning of the year check-in is a very simple process, there is no reason for students not to be informed beforehand where to check-in. Also, without any clear signs leading returning students to the correct check-in places, I wonder how any upperclassmen figure out where to go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EIf the housing department intends to create quick and easy check-in procedures for incoming students, the assumption that students will simply figure out where to check in is not helpful. It would be far better if housing had one designated location for each of the housing locations that dealt with anything to do with housing. That way, by the time a student became a senior, the check-in process would need no explanations and upperclassmen could help new students find where they need to go. Despite Housing’s attempts to make moving in easier for people in the past, students really need a notified check-in location for each housing area before arriving on campus. Simply, the process is relatively straightforward, yet each year’s scavenger hunt for the check-in location has not been helpful. A notice concerning move-in details would be greatly appreciated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82ceb",name:"What a Bucket of Ice Water Can Do For ALS",slug:"what-a-bucket-of-ice-water-can-do-for-als",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628ed741",name:"Rachel Chen",slug:"rachel-chen",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["als","icebucket challenge"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fik.imagekit.io\u002Fpaladin\u002F2014\u002F08\u002F14902713959_affdb11afb_o.jpg",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EUnless you’ve been living under a rock this summer, chances are you’ve run into or even participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge—the heroic act of drenching oneself with buckets of ice water in hopes of raising awareness and funds for Lou Gehrig’s disease, better known as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).

The Ice Bucket Challenge has been called a publicity stunt and associated with “slacktivism,” a pejorative term accusing participants of relieving themselves of any charitable action, such as donating money, merely by dumping water on themselves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg id=\"featured-image\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F08\u002F14902713959_affdb11afb_o.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Featured image\" width=\"409\" height=\"282\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cfigcaption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"409\"\u003E Photo Courtesy of Kyle Nishioka\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EWhile some of the concerns with the challenge are valid, there is enough evidence to suggest that the challenge, in fact, has succeeded in what it set out to do—raise awareness and funds for ALS research. The ALS Association has reportedly received an astonishing sum of $62.5 million, gathered 1.2 million Facebook videos, and attracted the attention of people everywhere in an amazingly short amount of time. Without the ice bucket challenge, most people would never even have heard of the crippling disease, let alone the effect it has had on an estimated 30,000 Americans.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EComparatively, $62.5 million is much less money than funds raised by many other well-known disease campaigns. For those who still question the actual amount of money going towards the cause and believe that ice companies are profiting more than the ALS Association, however, this is the most successful campaign this particular disease’s association has ever seen. Why is this the case? Perhaps it has to do with the fact that the disease only affects two out of every 100,000 people, meaning there is little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to find a cure. Hence, every penny counts, even if it’s “just” $60 million. Besides, ALS Association is not the only organization that benefited from the newfound publicity. According to Times, Project ALS, a smaller nonprofit organization also dedicated to ALS research, raised a huge sum of money shortly after actor Ben Stiller partook in the challenge\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003ELet’s face it: with all the endless stories we hear of different illnesses making their way through various parts of the world each day, it becomes more and more difficult to keep track of the effects of these diseases as well as the organizations we should be donating to in order to help put them to an end. The ice bucket challenge really is made for our generation of people embracing the “digital age.” Think about it: how many times a day do you find yourself scrolling through your Facebook and Instagram newsfeed? Is there really is not a more efficient way to spread the word about humanitarian fundraising campaigns than social media? You enter Facebook clueless to ALS and thousands of videos of friends and celebrities participating in the challenge later, you come out an expert on the disease and sympathizer for ALS patients. With hope, these videos will move on to make others will curious as to what all the fuss is about.

Especially for Westerners, it takes a thorough knowledge of the region to complete accurate assessments of its issues. The most recent crisis in Syria and Iraq has captured the world’s undivided attention. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, otherwise known as ISIS, is an Islamic group that aspires to impose harsh interpretation of the Islamic law (Sharia) through political control of the region. They have an overarching goal of establishing a global Caliphate. These Sunni sectarians have committed all kinds of crimes against humanity. The past few months have seen mass killing, public beheading, and instances of human trafficking to the Yazidi. Most of these crimes have targeted Shia’ Muslim, Christian as well as other faith groups of Iraq and Syria. The Sunni sectarians have also been destroying sacred and historic places in an attempt to cleanse the region.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg id=\"featured-image\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F10\u002Fisis-pic.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Featured Image\" width=\"365\" height=\"274\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cfigcaption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"365\"\u003E The flag of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.

Let us do what the mainstream media does not and look further, past the immediate consequences of the actions of ISIS. I once read an interesting essay titled ‘Empathizing with Saddam,” which I believe made me attentive to the mindset of irrational leaders and actors in foreign relations. ISIS emerged as a result of the 2003 war on Iraq by the US and other western nations to topple Saddam Hussein and clear the country of weapons of mass destruction. The loss of lives and property as a result of the war scarred the Iraqi population and left them feeling victimized. Through such traumatic experiences, many Iraqis lost faith in diplomacy and reason. They became more like to drift towards religious fundamentalism and extremism. ISIS and other Islamist groups then used these severely demoralized populations as a breeding ground for their destructive ideologies and as recruitment platforms for their political ambitions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThose running their own political agendas in the name of Islam are called Islamists, a term that well fits the ISIS. The ISIS uses the religious conviction of Muslims to further its own cause. Through the struggle to live a holy life, every Muslim is called a mujahedeen (noun of jihad). These groups, however, propagate the belief that Jihad is a holy war waged to enforce the divine will. This runs contrary to Islam. It does not take a thorough a knowledge of the Abrahamic faiths to know that, in such belief systems, war can never be considered holy. This is not to say that, in Islam, war may not be considered just. However, war cannot be a spiritual act. Peoples’ strong convictions, coupled with ignorance of the Qur’an, makes them susceptible to these kinds of politically-pointed, non-faith-based ideologies held by Islamist groups such as ISIS.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EThe fact that significant amounts of people joined and continue to join ISIS does not make the ISIS any less wrong. Enforcing Islam as a constitution on a national level takes away the faith aspect; people start “following” the religion not because they want to, but because they have to. Peoples’ roles in willfully following a faith are completely dismissed and instead replaced by authoritarian governance that enforces laws that once were left to free will. Though the media conveniently presents easy “answers” to complex questions as these, and current situations seem to enforce the stereotypes and skewed media coverage, I urge everyone to look holistically into ISIS’ actions and religious fundamentalism in general rather than to accept simplistic narratives offered by various media sources.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82ce9",name:"Justice on American Streets",slug:"justice-on-american-streets",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97744bc989e23628edeca",name:"Courtney Thomas",slug:"courtney-thomas",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["ferguson","furmannaacp"],description:"\n        \n      ",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fik.imagekit.io\u002Fpaladin\u002F2014\u002F10\u002Fcourtesy-of-overpass-light-brigade.jpg",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg id=\"featured-image\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F10\u002Fcourtesy-of-overpass-light-brigade.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Featured image\" width=\"515\" height=\"342\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cfigcaption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"515\"\u003E Overpass Light Brigade activists protest the death of Michael Brown using the phrase he uttered before the fatal shots.

On August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, a police officer shot and killed an unarmed teenager named Michael Brown. The previous statement is the only thing we can be certain of. Some say Brown committed a robbery before he was stopped by Darren Wilson, the officer that ended his life. The only people who know exactly what happened aren’t talking (possibly because one of them is dead). A private autopsy at the family’s request found that Brown was shot six times. The fatal shot is believed to be one of two that entered his skull. The remainder of the shots were found in Brown’s arms. Eye witnesses say that Brown had his arms up in the universal sign of surrender, thus prompting the slogan, “hands up, don’t shoot.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately after the shooting, protesters began to make their grievances known in Ferguson and across the country. The protests were immediately confronted by the police in a manner that cannot be called anything but aggressive. Liberty, the very foundation of our republic is caught in friendly fire.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EWhy does Ferguson matter? Ferguson matters because it follows a disturbing trend. Michael Brown was not the first, and though I may be labeled a cynic, I will say he will not be the last. When I think of the future, I worry. Yes, it seems paranoid, but how can I not worry if any son I have will be Black? My son could be Michael Brown, Jordan Davis, Trayvon Martin or Eric Garner. How will I tell him he has to act, dress, and look a certain way and maybe, just maybe he won’t be killed? In a 2012 report of justifiable homicide the FBI found that a white police officer killed a black person nearly two times a week in the span of seven years. Of these homicides 18 percent were under 31 years of age. What does this statistic mean for Black people today? What does this mean for Black mothers raising children?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003EWhile Black mothers may not know the aforementioned statistics exactly, they have developed a set of rules on how to be Black in America. Every single one of those rules hinge on the same end goal: stay alive. While strange fruit seldom hang from today’s trees, young Black men are still victims. They are victims of a system that tells society that they are dangerous and for what good reason? There must be a solution. We can find the solution on the streets of Ferguson, New York City, Boston, and yes, even Greenville. The solution is the same now as it was in 1954. Make your voice heard. When the people speak, this leads to meaningful structural and social change. While marching and petitioning the government might seem passé to some and tiring to others, we cannot stop. No matter how tired we are of fighting systems of oppression, we can never stop. Because while this may be a secondary issue to many of us, injustice and terror still roam American streets, haunting its citizens on a daily basis. And so with our hands up, we march; because we can never stop.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82ce0",name:"Reflections from Graduating Staff Members",slug:"reflections-from-graduating-staff-members",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-04-16T21:03:25.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed54f",name:"Trent McCann",slug:"trent-mccann",photo:null},{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628ed729",name:"Jacob Zimmerman",slug:"jacob-zimmerman",photo:null},{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed57c",name:"Bryan Betts",slug:"bryan-betts",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["feature","journalism","reflections","thepaladin staff"],description:"The Paladin's 2013-2014 sports editor, opinions editor, and editor-in-chief each share their parting thoughts concerning the university paper, the role and future of journalism, and reaching the end of their Furman careers.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fik.imagekit.io\u002Fpaladin\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Fcodyryanreigle1-e1397671551519.jpg",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Cody Ryan",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"size-large wp-image-4142\" src=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Fcodyryanreigle1-e1397671551519.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Cody Ryan Reigle\" width=\"700\" height=\"397\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cfigcaption id=\"attachment_4142\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Photo courtesy of Cody Ryan Reigle\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin's\u003C\u002Fem\u003E&nbsp;2013-2014 sports editor, opinions editor, and editor-in-chief each share their parting thoughts concerning the university paper, the role and future of journalism, and reaching the end of their Furman careers.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ETrent McCann,&nbsp;Sports Editor\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I didn’t read \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E before I started working for the paper two years ago.

In words, experiences seem sentimental, a part of some larger story — self-reflection makes the messy realities of life neater, and less beautiful.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJournalism is not a glorious activity. Sunday nights become Monday mornings working on layout to produce an issue, a collection of articles stamped onto a page that will be obsolete in three weeks. Worthwhile moments — witty sentences, well-placed adjectives, subtle arguments — pass by almost as quickly as the words form, subsumed in the worthwhile but transient process of reporting and analyzing the news. The hope is that these arrangements of words can and will deliver facts, participate in conversations, and describe Furman and its inhabitants in provocative and insightful ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of our major goals for the opinions section this year was to actively participate in discourses in which this newspaper was before only a passive observer, modeling what being a constructive but vocal part of Furman’s community should look like.

In his written reply, Vonnegut declined to visit, citing the fact that he had come to “resemble nothing so much as an iguana” in his old age, but he also enjoined the students to practice an art — be it poetry, dancing, journalism, or otherwise — without regard for quality or monetary compensation, for the sake of the process itself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong those lines, Vonnegut also gave the students an assignment. Write a six line poem, he said, make it rhyme and make it good, and don’t show it to anyone. He then furnished the following instructions:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Tear it up into teeny-weeny pieces, and discard them into widely separated trash recepticals [sic].

For reasons that will be obvious to my fellow staffers, producing a student newspaper has often felt like an enterprise modeling the classic thought experiment about sound and trees falling in forests. You know the one. Except with \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, I’m inclined to pose the question a little differently.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a student newspaper is published and no one reads it, does the publication matter?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E remains a print newspaper and that pundits have long heralded the coming demise of print journalism, a business that depends on the processed pulp of trees that have fallen in forests, regardless of whether they made a sound, is an irony not lost on me. The many stacks left on the stands at the end of each week are a testament to the difficulty of producing a print newspaper in an age of Twitter and Yik Yak and to the never-ending challenge of meeting readers where they are.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my point is not to suggest that no one, in fact, reads \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (though I will always remain bewildered by the upperclassman once overheard in the DH expressing surprise upon learning that Furman had such a publication). I have been encouraged this year by the many students, faculty, and administrators who have told me they read the paper, who have debated our coverage, and who have otherwise participated in the kinds of discussions that the newspaper exists to facilitate and promote. To all of you, the entire staff and I owe our thanks, for the support and the conversation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat’s more difficult for me to determine, looking back, is what it’s all meant. Not only the newspaper but also the ideals that direct its production have undergone constant evolution. Just this year, the publication has sought to do everything from document Furman’s financial situation and challenge administrative decisions to entertain with playful listicles and satire. Against the temptation to let the newspaper become just another assignment to complete and add to a resume, my goal and I think the staff’s goal has been to invest fully in making the publication better, in the many ways we’ve tried to define what that means.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E has been more central to my undergraduate experience than perhaps anything else I’ve done at Furman. It has been a source of both frustration and fulfillment and has shaped my relationship to this place where I’ve found myself and to the people I’ve found myself with. As I sign off, I admit to having no real solution to the questions about falling trees and unread newspapers. Nor will I follow Vonnegut’s instructions and tear up all existing copies of \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (the local animal shelter can surely put them to better use).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it is my hope that the paper has done more than just report on the university, that it has also, for the community of readers as it has for me, contributed to what we are becoming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82ce4",name:"Writers for The Paladin Win Five S.C.

As a student about to take the semi-self-annihilating dive into law school, that last part scares me a great deal. One of the ways that I cool my anxiety about finding a job later in life is reflecting on how good my Furman education has been. As a student who transferred to Furman from a big state school after freshman year, I can attest to the quality of the schooling we get here. While sweating under the pressure of the rigorous academics here at Furman, many students look longingly at their friends who went to state schools, where football is big and the beer flows like water. Those students should take a step back and realize the many benefits of coming to a place like Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the stereotypical talking points associated with small liberal arts schools is the benefit of small class sizes and individual attention from professors. This is something that we as Furman students can easily take for granted since we go to a school that makes good on that promise. Until you have had it the other way, it is hard to appreciate just how great small classes are. At the University of Tennessee, many of my classes had over 50 students in them. These classes met in auditoriums, and the professor stood at the distant front of the room attempting to speak to everyone, sometimes with the aid of a microphone. Discussion was a non-option in such a setting so the material for these classes had to be condensed in a manner that would not confuse anyone. If you were one of the people who were still confused, you could either wave your hand frantically to get the instructor’s attention from 50 yards away while aggravating your classmates who just wanted the lecture to end, or speak to a graduate student teaching assistant after class. Freshman year at Furman is much different. We attend seminars with ten or so of our peers, where discussion is essential and the professor is available to guide our thoughts. A 50-person class is unheard of at Furman, and that is a blessing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt state schools, students are allowed to live off-campus, and have a variety of housing options to choose from. This situation sounds like heaven to Furman students (especially if you are one of the unfortunate 150 juniors in the dorms this time around, God rest your soul) but it is really not all it’s cracked up to be. The effect of everybody living off-campus is stratification: students go to campus to attend classes and afterward immediately return to the small circle of friends at their respective apartment complexes. The seeming benefits of a huge student body are lost in this process. It does not matter if you have 20,000 classmates if you drive back to your apartment immediately after class and never see any of them. By contrast, Furman achieves a real sense of community by keeping everyone on campus. You run into people you normally would not meet and have experiences you would not expect to engage in when the majority of the student body are your neighbors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all have our gripes about Furman. Indeed, it seems like Yik Yak exists only so that Furman students can whine about how miserable they are. If not now, perhaps in the years after graduation we will realize what a great education we have earned here at Furman.

While everyone else had blonde or brunette hair, I had black hair. My peers wore sun dresses and cowboy boots; I wore jeans, a button up shirt and heels. Before even considering values, interests and personalities, physically, I was different from everyone else.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysical difference cannot be masked, and soon I learned to accept that I was just different. It was a harmless fact. Once I came to acknowledge that I was different — physically and culturally — being different became my main goal. I continuously reminded my friends that I was from a different country and that I did not hold the same values. Oftentimes I went out of my way to try to set myself apart. I was afraid that as I adjusted to life in the United States, I would lose my Asian culture and identity. I insisted on only eating non-Western food when eating out. I refused to buy non-heeled formal shoes. I refrained from watching Western television series, and I only listened to Korean pop music.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy efforts to preserve my own differences, however, only negatively impacted myself and the people around me. As I continuously pointed out differences between my friends and myself, we had no time to discuss topics of mutual interest. I was not learning anything about this new American culture that I had tried to immerse myself in; I was not any different from the person I had been when I first arrived at Furman. I was depriving myself of development and missing out on the rich experience of studying abroad.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I began to adapt. I found my interests and passions being altered and modified through a new willingness to consume Western media and engage with others in deep conversations. And I let it be. I stopped juxtaposing my values with Asian values and correcting myself had the two not matched up perfectly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I look back at my freshman year in college, I can’t deny the fact that I have grown. Who I am, the way I interact with my surroundings, my values — everything has changed. Perhaps “alter” and “change” and “different” are not the right words to use to define my identity. Life is not a mad dash from one stage to another, protecting one’s identity from being stained and changed. It is a process of finding pieces along the road to build one’s identity. Identity is something that is created as time goes by, something that is built upon through experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow did I transition to life in the United States? I developed my own identity. I understood that my decision to leave my friends and family to study in a foreign country was a part of my life that would develop me as a person and as an individual, an experience that would present a new piece of my identity, something always in the making.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82cbc",name:"Furman Engaged: Improving One of Furman's Finest Programs",slug:"furman-engaged-improving-one-of-furmans-finest-programs",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-04-10T22:03:59.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["feature","furmanengaged!"],description:"This annual event showcases the best Furman has to offer, but that positive reality should not prevent us from critically analyzing what we can do to make it better and clarify a vision for the role Furman Engaged! plays in the university’s educational mission.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fik.imagekit.io\u002Fpaladin\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Fengage13.jpg",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Fengage13.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"size-large wp-image-4028\" src=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Fengage13.jpg?w=700\" alt=\" \" width=\"700\" height=\"318\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery year, Furman Engaged! offers students a unique opportunity to present research, read papers, and showcase artistic and musical accomplishments in a setting similar to a major academic conference. This annual event showcases the best Furman has to offer, but that positive reality should not prevent us from critically analyzing what we can do to make it better and clarify a vision for the role Furman Engaged! plays in the university’s educational mission. The greatest danger for Furman Engaged! is that the event is merely a perfunctory requirement and a platform for presentation, not an opportunity for continued learning, discussion, and engagement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis potential danger manifests itself in a number of ways. First and perhaps most clearly, students who receive certain scholarships or grants like Furman Advantage are required to present on their research and internships. Either academic departments are responsible for organizing events and panels in which majors discuss their experiences, or students are responsible for presenting a poster summarizing their internship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe presentation requirement makes sense for students who receive the grant to do original research, but in other cases, the work that a student does over the summer may not lend itself to a presentation format — for example, students cannot easily present or make a poster about internships during which they worked extensively with private or classified information. Additionally, this can place an undue burden on departments to organize internship panels and events instead of working to organize other, more focused events that allow for the in-depth exploration of a topic or idea. Students who receive Furman Advantage grants or participate in internships should have the opportunity to publicly discuss their experiences, but the current requirement that everyone who receives Furman Advantage should present at Furman Engaged! causes the event to be overscheduled with posters and presentations that many not fit well within the model of Furman Engaged!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor too many students, Furman Engaged! is just a Friday without class, and many attend only events and sessions within their own areas of study or that they are required to attend as part of a class. So many events are scheduled simultaneously that students must choose to attend certain programs or sessions over many others, decisions often made based on one’s commitment to a department or area of study. This reality embodies the danger of Furman Engaged! becoming a collage of perfunctory requirements, stifling the interdisciplinary dialogues that Furman Engaged! exists to foster by not providing opportunities for students to consider the work of their peers in other departments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman Engaged! is an essential part of the university’s commitment to engaged learning, an education experience that teaches students by forcing them to confront the realities of the world and act to respond. As an event, Furman Engaged! is not fundamentally flawed. In fact, many of these issues might be addressed by expanding the format over multiple days, or over a weekend. An extended time period would give students more opportunities to present their work and reduce the number of overlapping sessions, a move which might facilitate greater interdisciplinary discussion. This would make Furman Engaged! feel less like an obligation or showcase and more like an occasion for the kind of intellectual debate and discussion that it is Furman’s mission to encourage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82cbe",name:"What Constitutes Diversity?",slug:"what-constitutes-diversity",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-04-10T22:00:58.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed621",name:"Stephen Edwards",slug:"stephen-edwards",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["admissions","diversity"],description:"Diversity in higher education seems to be something everybody wants.

At Furman, we are surrounded by committees, student organizations, and CLP speakers dedicated to making our school a more diverse place. But what kind of diversity do these organizations mean, exactly? Diversity of viewpoints? Of sexual orientation? Of racial background? The official Furman Diversity Statement takes a stab at pinning down this concept: “\u003Ci\u003Ethe University aspires to create a community of people representing a multiplicity of identities including, but not limited to, gender, race, religion, spiritual belief, sexual orientation, geographic origin, socioeconomic background, ideology, world view, and varied abilities\u003C\u002Fi\u003E.” That’s a tall order. Can anybody really be expected to look at a large group of people — the many students and potential faculty members who apply to Furman, in this case — and assess how “diverse” they are in terms of the 11 factors listed in the Diversity Statement? The task is Herculean, if not impossible. I say this not to discredit the efforts of the Furman Diversity Council, or other groups that attempt to promote their own ideas of diversity on campus. I merely want to highlight a disconnect between the popular conversation topic of “diversity” and the inherent difficulty of translating that abstract idea into policy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine that you are a member of the Furman Diversity Council. It is your task to uphold the values expressed in the Diversity Statement, while keeping in mind that its list of demographic factors is not exhaustive. There may be even more aspects of a student’s resume than the 11 quoted in this article that make him or her a contributor to a diverse learning environment. You begin with race because charting out the racial makeup of Furman’s student body and faculty is relatively straightforward. You then move to religious affiliation, which, on paper, is as straightforward as race, but you feel certain misgivings as you classify students according to what church their parents sent them to. Then you find yourself in the maelstrom of ambiguity that is sexual orientation, which poses so many difficulties in terms of classification that you don’t know where to start. In this hypothetical situation, we’ve already encountered innumerable hurdles to making careful decisions about what constitutes a “diverse” community, and we haven’t even gotten halfway through the list of factors that the Furman Diversity Statement says the University considers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this process is so difficult is that it is inherently reductive. It reduces people to the social demographics that they, on the surface, satisfy. Ironically, we are taught day in and day out that gender, sexuality, and race are not fixed categories and thus should not be a basis for judging other people. But how else can a Diversity Council judge people than on these superficial bases? They don’t have the time to meet all the students and professors who apply to be a part of the Furman community and personally consider their human differences — they don’t even have the time to meet everyone who is already at Furman. This is no discredit to their intelligence or their intentions. It merely goes to show how slippery a concept diversity is once you begin thinking about making a policy based on it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, most of the talk you will hear about diversity is a far cry from thinking of it in policy terms. In common parlance, “diversity” is a frivolous, empty word, usually uttered in passing and almost never with any substantive thought on the subject. Often, one will hear it thrown in with other terms of praise as a kind of filler: “We have introduced this policy with the objective of promoting intellectual engagement, diversity, and security.” Doesn’t that sort of language sound familiar?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI challenge readers of this article to go beyond routine discussions of diversity and to critically examine what actually constitutes a “diverse” community and why such a community would be worthwhile.

In it, the author remembers her father’s suicide, and explores their relationship through the lens of her own identity as a lesbian and her father’s relationships with other men. The work includes frank depictions of human sexuality and human bodies. These aspects of the text contribute to the fervor in the legislature surrounding \u003Cem\u003EFun Home\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, with the graphic memoir branded as pornographic by many state officials, who describe the work as containing content that violates community standards of decency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis case shows how we imbue the words we use to describe ideas and people with whom we disagree with a rhetorical power that covers over the realities of our argument.

What matters in this consideration is how easily the language that often accompanies discussion of LGBT issues in South Carolina can be characterized by a self-justifying moral aversion. Discourses of disgust and alienation — rejection as a reflex — are inherently problematic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI grew up in a small southern town in rural South Carolina, and I remember hearing in school almost every day derogatory sexual terms used as slurs by my fellow students to demean others. Children used the words carelessly, with little thought to what they meant, using insults to stigmatize and cause harm. In the mouth of a young student, those words were violent, used to cause pain and injury, expressions of power used to reinforce particular ways of life without regard for the lives of others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe words and actions of my classmates were not wrong because their language caused pain — we say words that hurt other people all the time. Instead, in these cases disgust takes the place of reasons and rejection becomes a reflex, an instinctual reaction often explained by sentiment and appeals to precedent. Without the coarse language, many of the adults in my town spoke in the same terms, using bigger, more sophisticated words to talk about moral decency, history, and the threats that the gay and lesbian lifestyle pose to community norms. Without a framework of articulated reasons, the language that adults use to object to homosexuality are subdued versions of the shows of force , too similar to the slurs thrown about carelessly by young students who do not realize the significance of what they are saying.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I would disagree and aspire to challenge them, there are reasons — political, philosophical, religious, social, even scientific — for why a person might object to alternative sexual orientations. Legislators justifying the decision to cut money from the budgets of the College of Charleston and USC-Upstate have not offered these kinds of reasons. Instead, they have appealed to community standards of decency and labelled these works with words they have failed to define. This justification is inadequate — we cannot call homosexuality wrong just because we do not like it, we cannot minimize people just because we do not understand them, and we cannot refuse to read books simply because they offend us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82cbd",name:"Reclaiming Wholesome",slug:"reclaiming-wholesome",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-04-10T22:00:37.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97744bc989e23628ede37",name:"Emma Zyriek",slug:"emma-zyriek",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Honey Maid, a company known for its sugary snacks, has just gotten a little sweeter.

However, much of the commentary on Honey Maid's new ad has been watered down to the tired \"is gay marriage right or wrong\" debate that has defined our country's so-called \"culture war.\" While same sex marriage is certainly a valuable and relevant cause — and more and more states are standing on the side of equality — it is important to recognize that Honey Maid's message is far more universal than the simple assertion that \"gays deserve to get married.” By looking beyond politics, Honey Maid succeeds in normalizing, rather than differentiating, American families who are consistently perceived as \"untraditional\" — the rocker mom and dad, the single parent, the interracial family, and yes, the same-sex couple.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other advertisements that show diversity, Honey Maid goes one step further, characterizing these many families not by their differences, but by their sameness. Throughout this short video clip, the audience is struck by an overwhelming sense of humanity, a series of smiles, hugs, and little moments that could be present in any happy household. This concept is further reinforced in Honey Maid's recent video response, in which all of the hateful responses to the \"This is Wholesome\" video are arranged into a beautiful art piece, spelling out the word \"love.” Both metaphorically and literally, love rises above our differences, transcending backgrounds, opinions, and identities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor decades, the religious right has championed the word \"wholesome\" when endorsing selective families that support traditional values. However, Honey Maid's advertisement radically reclaims this word, including all families — non-traditional and traditional alike — in the process. This in turn opens up possibilities for a more timeless definition of morality, one that evades politicization and upholds the rights of all citizens. More importantly, as societal perceptions change with every successive generation, \"This is Wholesome\" serves as a commentary on where our country is heading, suggesting that America is becoming more willing to define family not by appearance, but by love.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82cbf",name:"Home Sweet Home…or Not?",slug:"home-sweet-homeor-not",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-04-10T22:00:31.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97744bc989e23628edbfd",name:"Jai-Ryung (Jenny) Lee",slug:"jai-ryung-jenny-lee",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["housing"],description:"“Welcome Home.” Starting with the banner stretched above the main entrance to the speeches that used the phrase as a tagline during convocation, there seemed to be a silent force, warping and slowly transforming my preconceived notion of home — where it was, what it was, how I related to it.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fik.imagekit.io\u002Fpaladin\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Ffacilitiesservices.jpg",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Ffacilitiesservices.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4037\" src=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F04\u002Ffacilitiesservices.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"facilitiesservices\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Welcome Home.” Coming in as a freshman, these words seemed to come at me from all sides during my first few weeks at Furman. Starting with the banner stretched above the main entrance to the speeches that used the phrase as a tagline during convocation, there seemed to be a silent force, warping and slowly transforming my preconceived notion of home — where it was, what it was, how I related to it. “No,” the phrase seemed to say, “your home is no longer, well, home. Furman is your new home.” In my experience, most students have accepted this invitation and worked to make Furman their new home.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut every relationship — even abstract, figurative relationships like the relationship between a university and its students — requires reciprocation. It’s not only about students changing where home is for them. Furman has to play a part and take us in and fulfill its responsibility to us as residents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does Furman’s role in the student-campus relationship look like on campus? The university recently announced the building of a sidewalk to run from the Vinings to campus, the stated goal of which is to give international students who live in the Vinings but do not own a vehicle a better, safer way to travel to campus. This is how Furman takes students in as residents, a clear example of the optimum student-campus relationship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne area in which the university should work to be more sensitive to the needs of students is in the completion of campus maintenance. When the loud sound of trash disposal, leaf blowers, and lawn mowers interrupts students’ classes and sleeping schedules, how can students feel at peace in their new “home?” Perhaps we need to take a step back and determine which we prioritize more — students’ well-being or campus maintenance? There can easily be a harmonious compromise, one that recognizes there are 24 hours during the day, some of which students need to rest, concentrate, and study, and others during which necessary maintenance tasks can occur.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for the university’s policy regarding holidays. With the exception of breaks that happen between semesters, Furman does not require its residents to leave campus during holidays like Thanksgiving and Spring Break. Through this policy, Furman acknowledges that some students do not have family nearby to spend the holidays with and\u002For would prefer to stay on campus, whatever the reason. However, during the holidays, most of the campus shuts down. Must some centers and programs that may be critical for students’ well being, such as the infirmary and shuttle service, also be closed during these holidays? Considering that most students who stay on campus are international students that rely on these services, we should recognize who stays on campus and what services they still need. In this situation, is there not some happy compromise in which Furman closes some services, but continues to provide others?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps these problems are the result of a lack of communication between the students and administrators. There is no clear medium for students to express their concerns, to request that the campus be more welcoming and more responsive to their needs. If the university is not making the effort to understand what the students need, and perhaps even who the students are, how are students expected to call Furman “home?”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many different kinds of homes. Some are full of tension, and some are relaxing and comforting. Furman has the potential to become the latter for students, but there must be a clear way to communicate between students and administrators for Furman to become “home” for students during their pursuit of education and excellence at Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82cb5",name:"Liberty in North Korea",slug:"liberty-in-north-korea",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-03-25T05:03:21.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97744bc989e23628ede1c",name:"Lauren Chew",slug:"lauren-chew",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["northkorea"],description:"The highly politicized and isolated image of North Korea has made the issue look more hopeless than it should be.

Furman University’s annual Dance Spectacular Showcase provides the campus and Greenville with a unique opportunity. No other event or Cultural Life Program at Furman offers its viewers a total immersion into dance as a spiritual and performative art. The audience will participate in the nonverbal communication of dance as they view each piece of choreography.

The ARMES Program will perform two modern pieces for Dance Spectacular. The Nrithyanjali School of Dance will bring rural India to life on stage by showing how folk dancing is the essence of Indian art and comes straight from the hearts of its villagers. The Greenville Ballet School promotes lifelong learning, fitness, and an appreciation of the arts. The school, like the ARMES Program, will perform a modern piece for the showcase. Studio A Performing Arts Company will grace the stage with two unique pointe solos and a contemporary dance.

Speaking recently at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Alex Epstein, founder of the Center for Industrial Progress, accused those linking climate change to human activity of “human racism.” Rather than consider a conservative solution to our climate crisis, this CPAC panel was entitled “Can America Survive Obama’s War On Fossil Fuel?” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell blasted the Senate all-nighter as “30 hours of excuses.” This kind of rhetoric, pulled from both the extreme and mainstream wings of the Republican party, is not only detrimental to civil debate on the issue, it ignores the very concept of debate, replacing it with a sophomoric chorus of defiance and accusation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThis antagonistic tone is emblematic of the right’s habit of linking the environmental movement with fictitious visions of President Obama’s wars on “Big Oil” and “Big Coal,” two industries to which conservatives have financial and ideological ties.

This is why the University Center — now the Trone Student Center — one of the newest buildings on campus, was renovated before other older buildings. The circumstances surrounding the defunding of the men’s golf team highlight the need for open lines of communication between donors and the university’s administration. The administration should openly and publicly communicate Furman’s financial needs, and external donors must take the initiative to meet those needs instead of simply funding popular or high-visibility projects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82ca4",name:"In Defense of Fracking",slug:"in-defense-of-fracking",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-03-25T05:00:03.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed621",name:"Stephen Edwards",slug:"stephen-edwards",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"The practice of hydraulic fracturing, known colloquially as “fracking,” is too often the victim of unwarranted bad press.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fik.imagekit.io\u002Fpaladin\u002F2014\u002F03\u002Fdaniel-foster.jpg",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Daniel Foster",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"size-large wp-image-3960\" src=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffurmanpaladin.files.wordpress.com\u002F2014\u002F03\u002Fdaniel-foster.jpg?w=700\" alt=\" A fracking well near Shereport, Louisiana.

Fracking is the practice of pumping a liquid solution deep below earth’s surface in order to draw out fossil fuels for extraction. Many people are opposed to the practice, claiming that it contaminates drinking water and causes earthquakes, among other things. A look at the facts shows these alleged fracking evils to be non-existent or negligible. So why the continued protest? The problem lies in the worldview of today’s environmentalists, who, despite their good intentions, are inflexible, dogmatic, and ultimately opposed to progress.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EForemost among environmentalists’ concerns with fracking is the fear that fracking sites contaminate nearby supplies of drinking water. Fracking fluids that are injected into the earth contain additives that environmentalists claim end up seeping into local supplies of drinking water. This is a fear that reveals an unwillingness to dig deeper into the issue. First of all, fracking wells plunge on average 7,500 feet below the surface — this depth is thousands of feet below aquifers that provide drinking water. Secondly, the chemical content of fracking fluid is not particularly dangerous. The fluid consists of 99 percent sand and water. Keep in mind that fracking is primarily a physical process by which rock formations are loosened through intense water pressure. The remaining one percent of fracking fluid consists of chemical additives that are used to lubricate the process, as well as to provide some chemical assistance to the overall erosive effect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe real kicker for people who think these chemicals are dangerous comes from the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency conducted a study in 2004 that focused exclusively on the safety of fracking. This study found no compelling evidence that the chemical additives in fracking fluid were inherently dangerous, nor did they find a single instance of groundwater contamination as a result of fracking. Only recently has the EPA renewed its search for risks associated with fracking with a new study starting in a few counties in Wyoming. Fracking practices have not changed significantly in the last few years — no new risks have emerged. The likely cause for the renewed search is increased political pressure and public hype, not any legitimate cause for alarm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EDoes fracking cause earthquakes? There are, undeniably, confirmed reports of increased seismic activity around some fracking sites. However, we cannot allow media coverage of a few of these events to lead us to believe that they are widespread. The miniature earthquakes attributed to the fracking process are actually caused by a disposal practice by which water left over from fracking is injected deep into an underground well. There are many other ways of disposing of fracking wastewater — the injection method is one among many and is not found at all fracking sites in the United States. Further, there have only been eight documented cases of increased seismic activity due to wastewater injection. To put these incidents in perspective, there are more than 30,000 wastewater injection sites in the United States. If environmentalists are concerned about earthquakes, they ought to turn their attention to geothermal energy, which has a far worse track record of shaking up nearby communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EIf the arguments against fracking are moot, then why the persistent outrage? Opponents of fracking are simply unaware of the facts. Most of them are smart people who have probably heard something along the lines of what I’ve said in the preceding paragraphs. Their fault lies in an ill-placed conviction, an entrenched commitment to the basic principle that fossil fuels are necessarily bad. Environmentalists see themselves as stewards of progress. They think they are speeding an inevitable eclipse of draconian fossil fuels that will bring about an enlightened order of clean, renewable energy. This view is, needless to say, oversimplified. People viewing the world through this perspective miss the many benefits that fossil fuels have to offer. It is true that fossil fuels are a finite resource that will eventually become exhausted. But denying their usefulness now accomplishes nothing and does not bring us any closer to the green future to which environmentalists are so committed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82c92",name:"Giving Up of Golf: Lessons from the Defunding of the Men’s Team",slug:"giving-up-of-golf-lessons-from-the-defunding-of-the-mens-team",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-02-25T06:03:34.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["budget","paladingolf"],description:"On Feb. 7, Furman announced that the Board of Trustees had decided to discontinue Furman’s men’s golf program.

Although the announcement itself was a surprise, this move is consistent with the university’s stated goal of reducing expenditures in many of Furman’s programs and departments. The recent push by alumni to fully endow the men’s golf program and allow it to continue in the coming years does not diminish the significance of this decision. This administrative choice may deprive Furman of an established program, potentially leave the team’s coaches seeking employment with other programs, and place members of the team in a difficult position of having to leave Furman to pursue their athletic interests elsewhere. However, this decision is also the enactment of Furman’s plan to reduce the budget deficit by reducing expenses and demonstrates the administration's willingness to eliminate programs to reduce the budget.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the Trustees were forced to make a difficult decision in defunding the men’s golf program, they ultimately made a necessary choice in response to a difficult situation. If the university is serious about reducing the budget without drastically increasing costs, these are the kinds of sacrifices that task will require us to make.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs such a drastic measure — defunding an entire program — truly necessary? Men’s golf is one of Furman’s smallest sports programs, with lower costs than other programs like the football or basketball teams. The university recently invested in a new facility for both the men’s and women’s teams. In addition, Furman this year started both varsity men’s and women’s lacrosse teams. Why is Furman funding new sports programs while cutting a sports teams with an established history and current players? Why is this happening so suddenly, instead of after a period of public deliberation?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answers to these questions are disheartening but satisfactory. All sports programs are facing cuts as part of a campus-wide initiative to cut costs across the board. At a time when all of Furman’s programs and departments are facing restrictions, the men’s golf team is not being unfairly targeted. The lacrosse teams were established in part because an anonymous alumni donor gave a large sum of money to initiate the programs, and the teams recruit more students and draw students from geographic regions of the United States like the Northeast and Northwest. While onerous, the decision by the Trustees to eliminate a low visibility, low membership sport is consistent with the university’s cost-cutting position and may ultimately be necessary to prevent budget problems in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reaction to the announcement, alumni and supporters of the program have begun an online petition to challenge the decision, and according to Golfweek magazine, a number of alumni have already launched a fundraising effort to cover the cost of the men’s golf team in the coming years with the goal of fully endowing the program. Regardless of the success of this initiative, Furman’s administration and Trustees have set a precedent for eliminating programs with low enrollments or low visibility, a painful step necessary to alleviate Furman’s budgetary woes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefunding programs that define and give meaning to the lives of individuals is difficult, and submitting these decisions to a calculus of costs and benefits, dollars and bottom lines, seems wrong. We all can imagine the pain and horror we would experience if activities to which we had committed our lives were eliminated for reasons beyond our control. However, for the university to reduce the budget without substantively increasing costs for all students, the budgets of all programs will need to be reduced, and some programs will need to be eliminated. This is the administration’s stated position, and the Trustees’ decision to defund the golf teams reveals a commitment to that position in practice. For the good of the university as a whole, some programs (and in extension, some people) will be forced to sacrifice more than others. Hopefully, the difficult decisions like this one that Furman makes now will ensure future education and enrichment for generations to come.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82c94",name:"Is the Minimum Wage Moral?",slug:"is-the-minimum-wage-moral",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-02-25T06:00:36.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed621",name:"Stephen Edwards",slug:"stephen-edwards",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"President Obama has recently proposed that the federal minimum wage be raised to $10.10 an hour.

It is unclear whether he is doing this in order to score a political victory that might overshadow the failure of Obamacare or out of a genuine concern for the working poor in America. Whatever his intentions, raising the minimum wage is a bad idea. Proposals like the president’s most recent initiative stem from a seductive but flawed way of thinking that I would like to examine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EAdvocates of raising the minimum wage, and the minimum wage in general, have a cynical view of the employer\u002Femployee relationship. They believe that employers hold vast sums of money that they greedily withhold from employees by paying them unfair wages. Since workers are always being exploited, and employers always possess a surplus of funds, it follows that the government ought to come along every now and then and balance the scales a little.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EReality differs starkly from the way in which minimum wage advocates see the world. In reality, most businesses run on tight budgets that cannot sustain paying every employee, regardless of what they do, at least $10.10\u002Fhour. This is why unemployment rises right along with the minimum wage. When businesses are forced to pay workers more than they can afford to, they have to let some of them go. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that an increase of the minimum wage to the proposed $10.10 would result in the loss of 500,000 jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EAnother unintended consequence of the minimum wage is an increase in prices for consumers. Again, businesses rarely have excess funds to satisfy the demands of a mandated higher wage. When forced to increase wages, businesses often make up the difference by increasing the prices of their goods and services. If you are a minimum wage advocate, you might rationalize this fact by saying, “Well, consumers are the middle-class bourgeois — it’s okay if they suffer in order to give a little back to workers.” Alas, you would be sorely mistaken in such a conclusion. A lot of industries that employ minimum-wage workers provide the goods and services minimum-wage workers rely on every day. Who works at Wal-Mart? Minimum-wage workers. Who needs inexpensive groceries the most? Minimum-wage workers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E The minimum wage — at $10.10 an hour, at $7.25 an hour, or any other level — represents a gross oversimplification of the labor market. By mandating a minimum wage, the government is in effect saying that every person’s labor has minimum value. Think for a moment of the endless variety of minimum-wage jobs. At $7.25 an hour, you could be flipping burgers at McDonald’s, helping a farmer bale hay, or interning at a Fortune 500 company. Now ask yourself if it makes sense to appraise the labor exerted in all those jobs at exactly the same rate. Businesses and the people they employ ought to be free to negotiate wages — they are, after all, the ones who know the value of each other’s skills the best.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E In general, those who support the minimum wage do so for ethical reasons. They have an honorable desire to help those in need. Where minimum wage advocates go wrong is in their choice of means of helping the needy. There are better solutions to poverty than heavy-handed government mandates. Improving access to education, for instance, would allow people at the poverty level to acquire the skills they need to rise above minimum-wage employment. Softening environmental regulations might free up business dollars that could lead to new jobs — the list goes on and on. It is this writer’s hope that minimum wage advocates can be persuaded to direct their enthusiasm to one of these causes and give up on a well-intentioned but ultimately harmful law.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82c96",name:"Trapped in Theseus’s Ship: Retirement, Graduation, and Institutional Identity",slug:"trapped-in-theseuss-ship-retirement-graduation-and-institutional-identity",timestamps:{published_at:"2014-02-25T06:00:34.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628ed729",name:"Jacob Zimmerman",slug:"jacob-zimmerman",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"After graduation every year, a small number of Furman’s faculty members leave the university.

Yet in the context of the Olympics, one of the world’s most significant international sporting events, these slight changes in the color of those medals can inspire an entire country’s happiness, or as in the case of South Korea, an entire country’s ire.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest controversies of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics remains Russia’s Adelina Sotnikova’s gold medal win in the women’s freestyle figure skating competition, upsetting South Korean favorite Yuna Kim. The defending champion of the women’s figure skating program and winner of the gold medal in 2010 in Vancouver, Kim entered the games anointed as the frontrunner in the event. Everyone — the pundits, the spectators, the entire nation of South Korea — expected her to win, and she did not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpectations cause people to react with terrifying cruelty. There is no middle ground. Either a person succeeds in surpassing the bar set for them by others, or one tries and falls short. If the competitor fails to meet the set expectations, there are serious repercussions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, Sotnikova, and not Kim, faced the consequences of violated expectations. Nobody blamed Yuna Kim for receiving a lower score than Sotnikova, for skating what was officially judged to be the second best pair of routines at the sport’s most competitive and prestigious venue. Everybody blamed Sotnikova for robbing Kim, cheating her of the accomplishment she earned, taking advantage of corrupt judges or a biased home crowd to deprive Kim of what she deserved. Sure, Sotnikova made a mistake and then “pretended she was perfect,” as Ryan Bradley, a silver and bronze winning American figure skater, stated. After a closer evaluation of the judges, there do seem to be possible biases. As reported by many prominent news networks, judge Yuri Balkov has previously been suspended for colluding to manipulate scores, and judge Alla Shekhovtseva is married to the director of the Russian skating program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even if all this were true, is Sotnikova to blame? Did Sotnikova really rob Kim? Of course not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite this fact, people from all over the world are attacking Sotnikova, criticizing her gala performance, accusing her of “robbing” Kim when all Sotnikova did was skate a nearly perfect performance with zeal and enthusiasm. The judges may be corrupt, the system may be flawed, but Sotnikova, the 17-year-old first-time Olympian, is innocent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps we’re taking the Olympics too seriously. Or, put another way, perhaps we’re taking ourselves too seriously. Ranking every country by how many medals their athletes earn, bombarding event organizers with petitions against unjust judging, not congratulating a young figure skater for an excellent, life-altering performance — maybe we need to take a step back and understand that the Olympics is meant to be a time when countries set aside political and nationalistic differences to enjoy the sport.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeredith Vieria said about the opening ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Olympics, “It’s often impossible to separate the Olympics from politics.” It may be hard, yes, even impossible, but all should work to preserve the themes of peace, civility, and sportsmanship that the Olympics at their best embody.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"}],totalDocs:577,limit:25,page:18,totalPages:24,nextPage:19,prevPage:17,hasPrevPage:true,hasNextPage:true},pageTitle:"Opinion"},uses:{params:["category","page"],url:1}}],
