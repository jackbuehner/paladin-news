As outlined by James Madison in the tenth essay of the Federalist Papers, one of the greatest threats in any government by the people is that different groups will move so strongly in different directions that it will tear a democratic society apart. In arguing for the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, Madison describes the problem with the current partisanship in Washington, crystallized in the ongoing government shutdown that shows no signs of ending.</div>

Upperclassmen know that in previous years one’s late-night caffeine withdrawals and bagel cravings could be satisfied by the silver bullet that was the 1 a.m. study break at Einstein’s. But what if the Einstein’s hours are about a different kind of injustice than that which we are all prone to selfishly rant about?</div>

    <div class="description svelte-10sicl1">Just down the road at Converse, another small liberal arts college in South Carolina, students are getting a break from the pricey cost of higher education. The school administration recently made the decision to decrease Converse College’s 2014-2015 tuition by 43 percent, from $29,124 to $16,500. This may spark jealousy from the students attending Furman, the most expensive private university in South Carolina, but there are drawbacks to such a reduction.</div>

In his article, Rodrigue argued that the Furman Paladins model themselves on the magical knights of yore, describing our campus as fronting a “Paladin Brotherhood” that “more than likely [consists of] a covert international web of sorcerers and demon-killers.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe description Rodrigue offers of Furman University is true, except that the wizardry that occurs at Furman is hardly a secret. Rodrigue is not the first person to have noted similarities between Furman and Hogwarts, the wizard-training school rumored to be located somewhere in Scotland. In fact, this comparison has in the past been used in Furman's marketing material. Furman's former president Rodney Smolla was a known practitioner of the dark arts, before he was forced out as a result of his involvement in the occult. For video proof, see \"Harry Potter and the Ivory Tower,\" a video posted on Furman University's official YouTube channel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn his article, Rodrigue specifically claims that LSU quarterback Zach Mettenberger was bewitched when he attended youth football camps at Furman and warned that Mettenberger may be a magically-primed sleeper agent who would be activated by the Furman Paladins to achieve victory against the highly favored LSU Tigers. Although the Paladin newspaper has been unable to uncover hard evidence that Furman paranormal practices extended to indoctrinating young participants in Furman's sports camps on the off-chance that they become renowned athletes playing for colleges and universities against which Furman will later compete, such policies do not fall outside the realm of possibility. Mettenberger's interception, thrown on LSU's first offensive drive of the game and returned 74 yards for a touchdown by Furman player Reggie Thomas, serves as indisputable empirical evidence that spells placed on the quarterback may have had some influence on the game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, as Rodrigue correctly notes, Furman had a magical advantage going against LSU this past Saturday, why did Furman lose 48-16? Here the facts become unclear. One might argue that the SEC-calibur play of LSU's football team triumphed over the occult shenanigans of an athletically outmatched Furman football team. A more plausible explanation, however, is that Furman's loss is the outcome of a Faustian deal, a pact made with supernatural beings to empower Furman’s soccer program in exchange for football losses in big games, even given its sorcerous superiority. This second position is supported by Furman's eerily similar loss two years ago to the nationally ranked Florida Gators, despite being up 20 to 7 at the end of the first quarter.

The same narrative appears in the way that we often attempt to understand social ills like crime and poverty according to our own fear and ignorance regarding mental health. Interpreting a quality, characteristic, or thing as terrifying and evil allows us to condemn and discard it, instead of investigating what about it threatens us. As a society, we are inclined to turn away from things we do not understand. We try to describe people we categorize as mentally ill as evil, dangerous, people who have a proclivity for violence and harming others, using mental illness as a means to revile. We translate our disgust into a way of justifying our own lack of concern, using difference to discriminate. This often holds true for those affected by mental illness of any kind, as our lack of knowledge often causes us to oversimplify, reduce, and ignore the problem to pacify our own fears about our own failure to understand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EHow should we best work to overcome this stigma? First, we need to recognize that the topics and issues we place under the header of “mental health” are located in the experiences of individuals. “Mentally ill” is itself an inadequate term, one that does not fully account for the diversity of experiences and multiplicity of needs of those labeled as such. Some people diagnosed with mental disorders or individuals with what we might define as abnormal mental states are able to live full and happy lives, and their lives and experiences should not be delegitimized. In other cases, mental illness is a real and present problem, wreaking havoc on an individual’s relations, career, and health. In relating to people experiencing what we define as mental illness, we need to be clearly aware that no two cases are identical, and that treatment should reflect this multifaceted reality. The primary goal in any treatment regimen addressing mental illness, trauma, and distress should be giving those faced with these difficulties the power to define and inhabit their own lives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ESecondly, we need to put in place structures that provide assistance and support, both to help individuals and to combat general apathy or prejudice that can compound the struggles already faced by those working through and suffering from mental difficulties. On campus, Furman offers a counseling service, available to all students, that offers care for issues ranging from depression, anxiety, and excessive stress to emotional trauma. In Greenville County, programs like the Greenville Mental Health Center and the Carolina Center for Behavioral Health serve the Greenville community by offering services geared specifically to the treatment of mental illness. These programs are a step in the right direction, offering personalized care to tackle the problems that can be caused by mental illness at the source, and lead us toward a path down which mental illness is not just addressed after a crime or a breakdown.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EMental illness can catalyze serious social problems like substance abuse, homelessness, and crime, so attempts to support those with mental illness helps to both improve the lives of individuals and the life of a community as a whole. Any attempts to address these corrosive and painful conditions require us to address the mental states of those individuals trapped in such cyclical and destructive circumstances. In addressing the issue of mental illness politically and in our own lives, we have to consider the rehabilitation of criminals, the realities of a national education system that teaches and relies on behavioral norms, and socio-economic environments that leave few opportunities for those labeled as abnormal or different. Our understanding of those problems should always be informed by the impact mental illness has on driving people into situations in which they make harmful decisions. By reframing the debate in this way, mental illness stops being an element contributing to problems and becomes a way of creating solutions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EFinally, mental illness is not just an abstract medical category or general social problem and is not just something in movies or stories; it is something that touches all of our lives in real and personal ways. It is often too easy to overlook because the symptoms are not immediately apparent, but the hurt we cannot see is sometimes the most painful. Mental health matters because it directly affects everyone — family, friends, the person sitting next to you in class, the person you pass on the street. Moreover, a study from the CDC suggests that up to 50 percent of the population will experience some form of mental health problem in their lifetime, and another study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that in 2009 almost 5 percent of the population experienced a mental illness that impaired their ability to function. The most terrifying numbers are the tens of thousands of people who successfully commit suicide each year, the hundreds of thousands who hurt themselves, and the silent millions who struggle with suicidal thoughts. Mental illness is a real and pressing problem, and we can respond to mental illness in ways that give people the freedom to live fulfilling lives and power over their own identities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82bfe",name:"Cynicism in American Politics",slug:"cynicism-in-american-politics",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-10-31T04:00:03.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed621",name:"Stephen Edwards",slug:"stephen-edwards",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"How many times have you heard somebody say, “Amurrica!” in the past week?

We mock Southern culture, or big banking, because we want those big complicated things to be beneath us, so handily understood that we can dismiss them with a witty little quip.

Faculty members expressed a desire for a president who can make the case for a liberal arts education in an increasingly uncertain world and create an educational environment that can deliver on those promises. Staff members expressed the hope that the new president will capitalize on Furman’s academic strength and use it to promote the university to alumni, donors, and potential students. Disappointingly, only a few students came to their designated session, but some of those that did emphasized the president’s role as the ambassador and public face of Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe first consideration in choosing a president is the capacity of that person to lead Furman in uncertain economic and political times. This directly follows the hope of multiple faculty members that the new president tell a compelling new story about what the liberal arts and education mean. This task will require creativity, and an understanding of how to best promote and improve academic programs combined with the business expertise to make difficult financial decisions. This unique combination of academics and economics points toward candidates with experiences in the ivory tower and the boardroom, experience with applying big ideals in the everyday life of a large institution. At best, Furman’s new president will be willing to be push toward radical transformations required to make higher education and the liberal arts relevant, while respecting and maintaining what Furman as an institution means.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ESecond, the liberal arts works best when grounded in a concern for others. Often this compassion in the liberal arts is figured as an abstract, theoretical commitment, something to do but not something we do. The new president should be willing to look beyond Furman as an institution or a business to the larger role of Furman and the members of the Furman community in the world. This outward orientation can even reflected and embodied in the search process by selecting an individual with a history in public service or non-profit work, and by moving outside the social and cultural norms and parameters that too often limit Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EFinally, the president of Furman is not simply an institutional figurehead or the head of an administration or a set of departments. The office of the president in a extension of the entire university which is itself made up of disparate interests, competing perspectives. The new President of Furman University should be willing to immerse her or himself in this interconnected community, and push beyond it. This conception of the office says something about the role of the president, but it also implies two responsibilities in the selection of a president. First, the search committee and administration has the responsibility of updating and including the larger Furman community in the search process as much as possible.

Is the infusion of financial aid that contributed to the recent budget shortfall an investment in Furman’s future, or a misguided financial decision?

Our University will welcome back the conference to its campus on April 4th and 5th, 2014. The sixteen member institutions meet every other year and discuss a specific theme that is relevant to gender studies. The two current co-chairs of the conference, Furman professors Dr. Karni Bhati and Dr. Sofia Kearns, chose the theme for this coming year’s conference: “Intersections and Assemblages: Gender and Sexuality Across Cultures.” This general topic will allow for the discussion of the various ways we create and inhabit our own multifaceted identities, discussing the topic of gender the context of issues like cultural context, class, and race.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe past nine conferences have focused primarily on gender issues in our Western society, but this year the goal is to compare how gender issues arise and are dealt with across cultures. The ACS Gender Conference website details this year’s theme: “The theme of the conference recognizes and addresses the multiplicity and diversity of scholarly approaches and activism to the long-standing aspiration for the abolition of all forms of inequality based on gender and\u002For sexuality. It especially welcomes transnational, cross-cultural, or comparative perspectives on gender and sexuality.” The keynote speaker for the conference will be Michael Kimmel, an American sociologist and professor at Stony Brook University who specializes in the academic sub-field of Men’s Studies and is a spokesperson for the National Organization of Men Against Sexism (NOMAS). The majority of Kimmel’s research is on masculinity, and his talk will tie his research to cross-cultural themes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tenth biennial conference will provide a wonderful opportunity for Furman professors and Furman students. The topic of gender and sexuality is often avoided here on campus, but the conference will provide the perfect forum to get discussion started. Dr. Bhati encourages students to get involved in the conference and to explore how gender studies are involved in your particular academic discipline and areas of interests. Growing our discussion of gender studies at Furman will greatly enrich the University by creating room for everyone to consider questions and subjects often overlooked on campus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents and faculty can go to\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fblogs.furman.edu\u002Fbhati\u002F\"\u003E http:\u002F\u002Fblogs.furman.edu\u002Fbhati\u002F\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to register for the conference.

There will also be a CLP connected to the conference that all students will be able to attend. Feel free to submit an abstract of your own paper proposal before October 31 for the chance to present at the conference. Unfortunately, everyone will have to wait until April 2014 for the Intersections and Assemblages conference, but Dr. Bhati and Dr. Kearns encourage sharing both before and after the conference through Twitter (#GenderConf2014) and by joining the Facebook group entitled, “Gender Intersections &amp; Assemblages.” Students and faculty should participate in this event and cultivate a space at Furman where gender issues can be explored freely and whole-heartedly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82be9",name:"Government that Works",slug:"government-that-works",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-10-08T04:00:09.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628ed729",name:"Jacob Zimmerman",slug:"jacob-zimmerman",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Democracy is violent almost by definition.

In responding to the deviciveness of factionalism, Madison argues that a commitment to constitutionally enshrined political structures can counteract the dangers of democratic differences, giving us an inherited solution to the problems that are currently manifested in Washington.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EDespite appearances, our democracy is not active combat, it is a game with explicit rules.

Instead, the Constitution articulates a complicated system of rules and structures, a blueprint for governance that allows for the flexibility of democratic change while preserving an essence of individual liberty. Bracketing differences, we can use the Constitution to determine how our government works and consequently resolve the problems when our government is quite literally not working.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe Constitution does grant to congress the responsibility of writing the federal budget and managing federal expenditures. However, that power should not infringe on the process by which laws are drafted, enacted, and reviewed. Congress should not use the budget to set specific policies, just as it would be wrong for the president to refuse to enforce laws without a judicial mandate, or for the Supreme Court to create laws, restrictions, and requirements outside of the context of individual cases brought before them. While the Democratic Party and the current administration are far from blameless in creating the current political climate, the brunt of responsibility specifically for the current government shutdown falls on congressional Republicans, who are attempting to legislate through a budget and in doing so are misappropriating an enumerated power to an excessive end.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EWhy are congressional Republicans acting as they are? There are two possibilities. The first is that congressional Republicans are using this debate over the budget and the upcoming debt-ceiling debate to achieve a specific political goal, defunding the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare. The second possibility is that congressional Republicans have refused to propose or vote on a budget because they believe that the federal government is a general evil, and that many programs included as part of that government should be reduced or eliminated. Both of these positions are perfectly viable and both contribute to the current Republican position, but the way in which congressional Republicans are pursuing these complementary goals is inconsistent with the structures outlined in the Constitution. Congress can enact and repeal specific programs and legislation, and congress can draft budgets for the federal government allocating spending, but congress cannot do both at the same time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EIf Republicans wish to repeal Obamacare, they should seek to do democracy better by electing representatives to office and repealing the law according to the prescribed procedure.

Simultaneously, President Obama and congressional Democrats should recognize the rights of the House of Representatives to play a role in setting the federal budget, and be willing to negotiate on those terms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EOne of the difficulties in acting from the United States Constitution is that although everyone agrees that the Constitution is important, partisan divides appear in its interpretation and implementation. While there is no straightforward solution to this problem, we all can perhaps agree on the simplest picture the Constitution paints,and when arguing against overzealous or intrusive judges, an overreaching executive action by a president, or a presumptive legislature, we all have to keep in mind the functions of each branch of government within our existing system. While this political lesson is one that could be better appreciated by all sides of the debate, in the case of the current government shutdown it is the Republicans in congress overstepping their bounds by trying to eliminate a law they dislike without following proper procedures.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThis particular response to the political problem of partisanship may seem unsatisfying, because it offers rules and parameters but no definitive answers.

If we are unhappy with our government, we have the democratic to change it, to vote, act, and work for what we think is best. This leads to differences, but a shared commitment to the democratic structures that allow for disagreement to play out as civilly as possible.

There is always panic. There is a persistent fear that the United States education system is failing our children. In many ways it is. We are ranked 27th in math, science, and 27th in literacy according to a report released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2009, consistently ranking below other industrialized countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Russian Federation. High school graduation rates are dismally low in large sections of the country. Problematically, what seems to motivate education reform is a fear of “losing” on the world stage, not a fear of failing future generations. Many articles and discussions about reform begin by portraying the educational landscape as some sort of “Cold War” in which the only useful weapons are math and the sciences. We are concerned with beating other countries, not educating our own students. In this haze, we lose focus of what could ultimately help to heal a fractured system: the arts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EFor some, the arts are nothing more than a pleasant distraction. Often not considered a part of the core curriculum, the arts — music, dance, theater, to name a scant few — are usually the first programs cut when school districts begin to balance a budget. People believe that there is no direct benefit from learning to play an instrument, to paint, or to dance. This perception of the arts is limited. See any one of the numerous studies that link studying the arts to improved language skills, math comprehension, literacy, and even self-esteem. Experts in brain development agree that the arts incorporate analytical and creative thinking in incredibly beneficial ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EI believe that arts programs do so much more than simply produce artists. Most orchestra and band teachers in the public schools are well aware that most of their students will not become professional musicians. Their objective is to teach their students lessons that transcend the physical activity of playing an instrument. To perform music well, one requires knowledge of history to apprehend the context of the music, an understanding of mathematical principles of rhythm and music theory, and the capacity to read an entire musical language. A music class is the synthesis and application of what many consider to be the core standards, the objective goals of an education.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EI am a classically trained violinist, and the greatest lessons I have gained from my study have not been about how to play the violin. When I was young, I was bullied relentlessly. Coming to music, I was looking for the skill that would make me “cool.” In hindsight, I realize that the violin was not the route to take to achieve that superficial hope, but what I gained from my study of music was more important than status. I learned not to put stock in how others appraised me. Music mattered to me, and I eventually came to understand that I mattered through music.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe arts are by design introspective. Music continues to teach me lessons about myself and the ways in which I interact with others. I have learned helpful life lessons and helpful job skills. For example, you do not have to like your co-workers to accomplish a task; sometimes the objective is greater than the individual. I realized that things worth pursuing require patience and effort (a valuable lesson for all children). I was exposed to diversity that helped to shape my worldview. Perhaps most importantly, the first time that I felt validated by someone outside of my family was in a music class.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EYou may read my experience as only telling an individual story. I would agree that it is personal, but I am not alone in this story. The conflicts and concerns facing children and teachers in the classroom do not involve outdoing other children in other countries around the world. Education is an end unto itself, not simply a means to economic productivity, international superiority, or financial wealth. The arts in education provide a unique opportunity for the application of knowledge and self-discovery in a world often devoid of both. Panic is never a useful tool in solving problems, especially with children, and we should not allow that panic to deprive our children of a complete and worthwhile education.

That's one area where Furman is not lacking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the Furman admissions department, about 85 percent of Furman students received some sort of financial aid last year. The average amount was around $20,000. That brings Furman's average tuition to about $21,532, not that far from Converse's $16,500.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman is part of a national trend of high sticker prices and equally high discounts offered by colleges and universities. Last year the average tuition discount hit a record high of 45 percent, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers. Another study from Pew Research found the \"money you don't have to pay back\" category increased 4 percent in the past four years for college students in America.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these discounts do not cover up for the fact that most of the country believes college tuition is excessive. According to last year's TIME survey on higher education, 80 percent of the general public thought the education that students receive at college is not worth the price. Not surprisingly, only 13 percent of private school officials agreed. Do the opinions of school officials matter? They aren't the ones paying back thousands of dollars in student loans. Two-thirds of the class of 2011 held student loans upon graduation. The average borrower owed $26,600, according to a report from the Institute for College Access &amp; Success' Project on Student Debt. Yet Furman students don't seem to be having a problem paying back their loans, as the school was ranked third for colleges in South Carolina with the greatest lifetime return on investment according to AffordableCollegesOnline.org.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not seem likely that Furman will follow in the footsteps of Converse College, given the recent increase in the amount of scholarship money provided to incoming students that led to our current budget deficit. Though next year's tuition fees will not be decided until the trustees meet in March, the last four years can be a good indication of their decision. Each year shows about a four percent increase in tuition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there are certain programs unique to Furman that help alleviate the financial burden of a private university. This past summer I received a fellowship from the Furman Advantage program, which directly funds student internships. These stipends range from $1,500 to $3,000. Another promising financial development at Furman is the recent $1 million commitment designated for need-based scholarships for students studying abroad.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo which is better for college students: high tuition and high discount or low tuition and low discount?

Summers rightly states that acquiring competence in a foreign language requires a great deal of time. However, for someone who is extolled as an economist, his math seems to be off; learning a foreign language is an investment that does, in fact, pay enormous dividends. For one, languages have the power to create in people a discipline for lifetime learning. (And contrary to popular wisdom, discipline, not some Mozartean gift, is key to learning and maintaining one’s abilities in a foreign language, and the former is an admirable quality in any area of life). Plus, taking the time to learn a foreign language signals an interest in understanding another culture and history. This is indeed a critical message to be sending, especially for the United States, whose penchant for taking center stage in the international community is not always met with the acclaim of critics.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EMore relevant to Furman University, however, is the importance of the humanities in general and foreign languages in particular to a liberal arts education. As an initial matter, a liberal arts education fosters a spirit of free inquiry. The academy provides a space in which students are not guided exclusively by the constraints of immediate relevance and utility. Furman, with its myriad general education requirements, does a remarkable job of giving its students the tools (i.e., the ability to engage meaningfully with the human and natural worlds, to examine critically their beliefs and values, and to problem-solve creatively) to become active, thoughtful citizens. Furman’s foreign language requirements not only allow students superior access to some of the riches of Western civilization, but they also illuminate the liberal ideal of heightening one’s capacity to overcome real-life cultural barriers in pursuit of common understanding.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EStill, the “liberating” aspect of a Furman education is not guaranteed. Because of what can only be described as misguided austerity measures, some smaller programs on campus are facing the possibility of being phased out. And as a former German studies major, which finds itself on the losing end of these changes, I find this appalling, particularly in light of the university’s intent to pump more money into athletics. (I want to be very clear about this: Furman has always been known for its academic, not athletic, prowess; we have Clint Dempsey, fair, but more often we receive plaudits for something such as\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Foedb.org\u002Filibrarian\u002F10-tiny-colleges-with-truly-impressive-libraries\u002F\"\u003E producing more Ph.D.s than any other liberal arts school\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.) This direction in which Furman is headed compromises the university’s seriousness of purpose as a leading liberal arts institution. To be frank, I do not know whose strange priorities these are, but I suspect that they are those of neither the faculty nor the students.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThis is not to say that one discipline, such as German studies, is more significant than another. Far from it. But students need exposure to the gamut of academia if they wish to be fluent in and knowledgeable of the culture of the West (and, as my Fulbright year showed me, able to explain this culture to those whose own is different). German writer Goethe is over two centuries old. However, even today we can still read and appreciate his work in the original (and the same goes for Homer, who is almost 3,000 years old!). This ability to link a culture and time is what makes language study so arresting. And what languages and other disciplines offer, together, cannot be measured in bottom-line finances or enrollment numbers. Thus, in my (never) humble opinion, Furman, as a liberal arts college, has a responsibility to provide an environment in which students can explore a breadth of disciplines and cultivate cosmopolitanism in the broadest sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82bb9",name:"Evaluating the First Year Seminar",slug:"evaluating-the-first-year-seminar",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-09-19T04:00:53.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed5b5",name:"Unknown",slug:"unknown",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["academics","firstyear seminar"],description:"Right now, Furman is in the process of re-evaluating its First Year Seminar Program.

In the upcoming year, the oversight committee will be collecting information from students and faculty, researching student evaluations from seminars in years past, and proposing a potential set of changes to the faculty for a vote.

Seminars offer students the opportunity to begin building a close relationship with a professor. Writing seminars do equip students with the skills needed to write papers at a college level and introduce students to the multitude of resources available to them through the university library. These writing seminars function as prerequisites for a number of upper-level courses, giving students the flexibility to take courses that suit their interests instead of simply restricting them to introductory-level courses in many academic departments. Also, if students are able to take a seminar that corresponds to their interests, the program offers a unique opportunity at the beginning of college to study a specific academic subject in a thorough and intensive way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ESecond, what about the First Year Seminar program needs reevaluation and revision? The way in which classes are assigned gives students very little agency, and students often find themselves placed in specific studies that fail to pique their interests and that do not relate to the disciplines they want to study. The inconsistency in the content and difficulty of seminars compounds this problem. Some seminars are disproportionately difficult and require extensive research and work, while other seminars are less rigorous.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThird, how can the university change the seminar program that maintains the positive effects of the program while minimizing its less effective aspects? First, students should only be required to take one seminar, in the fall semester of their freshman year. This seminar should focus on cultivating writing skills in relation to a specific academic topic. Second, the seminars offered should be general and diverse enough so as not to limit students to studying a specific subject that fails to further their academic interests. Finally, the requirements for seminars need to be outlined with greater specificity, implementing standards that give professors the freedom to explore particular academic topics in complex ways while differentiating seminars from typical lecture courses. The university’s goal should be to create set of seminars for students in the first semester of their first year to provide students with the skills required to navigate their college experiences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EFinally, we need to realize what role alterations to the First Year Seminar program could have in larger policy debates on campus. More seminar classes require more professors to teach those seminars. Further, since beginning the seminar program in 2008 the university committed to hiring 15 new faculty members, in part to offer seminars. This trend of hiring new professors seems to be shifting in the opposite direction, as the administration is not replacing retiring professors in some departments. Only requiring one seminar per student would be one way to free up professors to teach other courses, which seems particularly relevant in light of the university’s current reluctance to replace retiring professors. These larger consequences should not dissuade us from evaluating the First Year Seminar Program on its own merits and flaws, but we must also realize that the choices the university makes in this situation affect a number of other areas of concern. We cannot discuss the seminar program in a vacuum; discussions about the seminar program should occur in a larger context and with an eye to other debates, issues, and questions that we should be addressing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82bb8",name:"A Euphoric Weekend",slug:"a-euphoric-weekend",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-09-19T04:00:29.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628ed759",name:"Maggie Austin",slug:"maggie-austin",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["euphoria","greenville"],description:"Did you know that by attending Euphoria, Greenville’s food, wine, and music festival, you would get the chance to rub elbows with community leaders, celebrity chefs, recording artists, and members of the national media and raise a little money for charity in the process?

A United States citizen, Father Greg began his work in San Lucas during the long civil war conflict in Guatemala. When he began, San Lucas was in desperate poverty. The woman described the darkness of the town’s past with inadequate sanitation, health care, land rights, etc. The life of the indigenous Guatemalan at that time was grim. According to her memory, things began to change with the arrival of the visionary Padre Greg. One at a time, key services were brought to San Lucas. A health clinic, a center for women, an orphanage, a church library, etc. were all projects he saw to completion. Today, residents of San Lucas Tolíman have a standard of living far exceeding the standard at the time of Greg’s arrival.

It was a year marked by exciting new intellectual and emotional realizations. Professors and books exposed us to the realities of the world’s stark needs and inequalities. Fueled by sudden independence of mind and being, we are filled with grand ideas for social progress. In this raw moment of enlightenment, how did we respond? To all dreamers, when we see problems and hold passionate solutions, do we turn away? According to popular wisdom, to turn away is perfectly acceptable. “Be pragmatic.” “Plan for the future.” “Don’t waste your talent.” “Don’t you want enough money to enjoy retirement?” “What can one person do, anyway?” “It isn’t as easy to change the world as you seem to think it is.” The weight of these doubts is enough to subdue any thought of long-term public service. The image of a steady, predictable, and respectable job may seem more inviting than the uncertain and possibly dangerous life of a teacher, non-profit administrator, missionary, or other public servant. Would any sane and successful Furman student surrender a stable life for the unknown?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, what can one person really do in the face of such large problems?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of Padre Greg.

Questions remain about how these forums will be conducted, and what impact they will have on the larger search procedures. Are these forums simply informal surveys of general opinions, or will the forums take the form of constructive dialogues, with both committee members and members of the larger Furman community? What information will students and faculty provide to the search committee, and what information will the committee reveal in return? Optimally, the forums scheduled about two weeks from now will give students and faculty the opportunity to interact with the search committee and will be the beginning of an inclusive and transparent process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trustees and the Search Committee are ultimately the bodies charged with selecting the next university president and determining general university policy for years to come, but those decisions impact students and faculty in direct and immediate ways, and students and faculty deserve to have their voices heard and questions answered throughout the search, not simply at its outset.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConducting a search for a new president — identifying and interviewing applicants, exploring options, maintaining confidentiality, and ultimately making a definitive decision for the university — is a delicate and complex endeavor. However, complexity and difficulty are no excuse for a lack of a communication. The more input students and faculty are allowed in the process, the better the search committee will be able to select the candidate best equipped to lead the university.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe search committee can meet these conditions without compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the process. Although the committee cannot release the names of the applicants, the committee could update students, faculty, and alumni on the characteristics of candidates being considered throughout the process. Most importantly, the search committee should offer indications that input from faculty and students is having an effect on the search process. This accountability could take the form of reports communicating how the search is progressing, or subsequent forums occurring throughout the year in which the committee continues to offer updates and the students and faculty continue to offer feedback. Instead of simply identifying what qualities and characteristics students and faculty consider most important at the beginning of the search and using that indefinite picture as a guide, the committee should periodically return to the Furman community and hold subsequent forums to refine and review the picture as the committee fills in more details. The worst of all possible alternatives would be disconnected silence, separating the search committee from the life of the institution that the new president would be expected to lead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe presidential search is not and should not be a democratic election, and the search committee is required to manage a variety of interests in completing their assigned job. The Furman community should respect the difficulty of the committee’s task, and accept that the individual eventually selected may not fulfill every ideal expectation. However, the committee should also respect the larger Furman community by allowing for as much transparency as the reality of the enterprise permits. Even though they have been been entrusted with the power of the selecting the new president, the search committee should still be accountable for explaining and justifying that decision.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe presidential search is moving forward, but the faculty survey and forums suggests that the Presidential Search Committee is interested in input from the faculty and is willing to engage directly with members of the Furman community. These shows of good faith should be the defining beginnings of an honest, open process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82bad",name:"Student Government and You",slug:"student-government-and-you",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-09-11T04:00:29.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628ed825",name:"Brian Boda",slug:"brian-boda",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["presidentialsearch","sga","tronecenter"],description:"Welcome back to all returning students!

It became America on trial for all its racial prejudices, with George Zimmerman, representing the remnant of American racism, against the unfairly-profiled, misunderstood black teenager. Conversely, Zimmerman became a symbol for political opponents of gun control and proponents of Florida’s “Stand your Ground” law, many of whom hardly bothered to ask whether Zimmerman’s actions qualified as self-defense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn trials like Florida v.

Trayvon Martin was put through a similar metamorphosis: he lived a suburban lifestyle that anyone would consider middle-class, yet by the time of the trial’s verdict his banner was flown in all of America’s inner cities, as if his situation mirrored the prejudice that those inhabitants face on a daily basis. These valorized characterizations are the result of pressure groups — the NAACP, the NRA, and others — warping the complex facts of the case to fit their narrow agendas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe media ate all of this up, of course. It made a great story, palatable to a national audience because of its supposed simplicity.

How could the facts come to light amid all the screaming about “institutionalized prejudice,” “racism in America,” “police profiling,” etc.? Dirty politics hijacked the judicial process, and the most immediate victim was justice, and the resolving certainty that goes with it. Thanks to opportunistic groups like the NAACP and the NRA, and a news media hungry for an inflammatory story, jurors in Zimmerman’s case faced a choice between black and white, a horrible oversimplification.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we acknowledge, then, that politicizing a trial destroys its aspirations to justice, what else can we learn from Florida v.

Now is the opportune time to reflect on the recent past and the future of Furman University and to evaluate what policies and practices are worth maintaining.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Smolla began his duties at the beginning of the 2010 school year, the university faced a number of unique and unprecedented challenges, many stemming from the ongoing recession and the regressive state of higher education. Smolla and the university administration began to put in place a number of policies aimed at addressing problems like the increasing cost of tuition, the decreasing number of applications and the difficulties related to applying the principles of liberal education to an ever-changing and uncertain world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs one would expect, some of these policies were more effective than others. By increasing international admissions and supplementing the already expansive study abroad program, Smolla’s administrationworked to bring a new group of talented students to campus while working to better connect Furman to the outside world. The renovation of the Trone Center, Football Stadium, and Dinning Hall parking lot improved facilities at Furman that will receive extensive use in the next decades.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess successful were the administration’s attempts to reduce the amount of financial aid provided to students and increase the size of individual classes, causing tension between the university administration and the university faculty.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, however, Smolla’s greatest accomplishment also highlights one of the largest and most pervasive problems Furman faces today. Smolla accentuated the need for elevated civil discourse, a hope undermined at Furman by a lack of transparency and clarity regarding university policy. The idea that open dialogue and constructive debate is the best way to generate solutions to problems is consistent with a liberal education — the cultivation of creative, critical thinkers open to the merits of different perspectives — and is antithetical to an institutional culture that privatizes information and policy, a culture all too prevalent at Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe housing debacle of the spring semester embodies this self-inflicted dilemma of transparency and an absence of civil discourse. Faced with the need to better manage university resources, uncertainties about the size of the incoming freshman class and a large rising junior class, Housing and Residence Life attempted the apply two solutions. First, Housing no longer allowed students studying abroad to reserve rooms, and when this policy was rescinded due to backlash from students, Housing proceeded to place a number of rising juniors in the dormitories and a number of rising sophomores on the waitlist for living spaces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis second policy allowed Housing the flexibility to better assign living spaces once Admissions confirmed the size of the incoming freshman class, but this policy left many students feeling as though they had no recourse or choice in selecting their housing. A manageable institutional problem — irregularities in enrollment that lead to uncertainty in how to best allocate student housing — was compounded by a failure of the administration to communicate the reality of the situation to the student body and the inability of students to communicate their misgivings until after the policy had been put in place.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow might the situation have played out with civil discourse as a guiding principle? First and foremost, the administration would inform the student body of the situation before implementing policies that directly affect the student body and offer forums and spaces for discussion before the implementation of policy, not after. By integrating students into the institutional decision-making process, this approach would require students to take responsibility for the problem and recognize the need for sacrifices, instead of simply looking for ways to preserve their own individual interests, and would optimally allow for a solution that solves the problem but does not unduly disadvantage any one group. A full integration of the student body, faculty, and administration in the decision-making process through the use of open forums would allow every interest and perspective to be represented and ultimately result in the best solutions to the problems we as a university face.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmolla’s greatest legacy at Furman will be his advocacy for civil discourse, paving the way for the trust and openness that such a commitment requires. Our responsibility as students, faculty, administrators, and alumni is to live out this goal. We all have different and often competing visions of what Furman university should be. A commitment to civil discourse should not diminish these differences. Instead, civil discourse and the trust and transparency it entails remains the best way to address differences of perspective and make those collective visions a reality.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82b95",name:"Familiarity and Opportunity",slug:"familiarities-and-opportunities",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-08-28T04:00:34.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628eda1d",name:"Carl Kohrt",slug:"carl-kohrt",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["furmanpresident","kohrt"],description:"Welcome to all of the members of the Furman family — new and returning students, parents, faculty, staff, administrators, coaches — as a new academic year in the life of Furman University begins.

As in nearly all beginnings, there are things familiar and unchanged and things unfamiliar but full of opportunity. Let’s start with what you, the students, might notice as new or different upon your return.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, just after commencement exercises President Rodney Smolla announced his resignation, and the trustees appointed me as the interim president. As an alumnus (’65, chemistry) and the parent of an alumnus (’84), I am excited yet humbled by the opportunity to give back to my alma mater in this unexpected yet special way. I can assure you that I have Furman’s future and best interests in mind, and that I am not a mere “caretaker” but a person who is devoted to ensuring Furman’s leadership as an institution of quality. To that end, I met with Student Government Association President Brian Boda the third day following the announcement and sought his counsel about ways that I could meaningfully interact with students to hear your ideas and to share mine. He has quite an agenda for me, and I look forward to working closely with him and other student leaders this year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy wife Lynne and I have also played “Undercover Boss” and joined several of the summer tours for visiting prospective students and families. We both agree — we would still want to enroll at Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is the fabulous reconfiguration of the Trone Student Center. The completion of the first floor and exterior venues includes the “Paddock,” a restaurant that includes the serving of alcoholic beverages consistent with our University policy and which complements the other dining services on campus. The Trone Student Center will now also serve as the destination for all Student Life opportunities, providing one-stop shopping ranging from the Cothran Center for Vocational Reflection, the Rinker Center for Study Away and International Education, and Career Services, Internships and Student Life offices to student government, clubs and organizations and the Heller Service Corps. It’s also a great place to just hang out with friends. And returning students will find the old-fashioned mailroom and mailboxes have been supplanted by an entirely new “electronic alert” system that is more cost- and time-efficient for students and staff and which provided more room for the expansion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird is Furman’s commitment to help you begin applying your academic experiences in the “real world” through expanded internship and research opportunities. One of the most significant of these is an impending relationship with the Greenville Health System (GHS), which has designated Furman as its undergraduate partner (joining Clemson and USC as research and medical instruction partners, respectively). This partnership will provide many new and developing opportunities for internships across the spectrum of health care, from hospital administration to clinical experiences, that will be a useful resource for those aspiring to a career in the medical field.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, the football field house is in its last stages of construction and will not likely be completed for the start of the season — but not to worry, we will all get to say, “Go Paladins!” Sept. 14 at our first home game and the first game on the new artificial turf under the direction of Coach Bruce Fowler; that day has also been designated as “Paladin Rising,” and a surprise halftime presentation is being planned. Men’s lacrosse will take the field next spring to open their first season as Paladins, and of course our wonderful coaches of men’s and women’s soccer, tennis, golf, and cross-country will all be leading their respective teams to victories one after the other this fall.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I speak for everyone here in welcoming an accomplished freshman class representing 40 states and 21 foreign countries. You are class presidents and valedictorians, talented athletes, musicians, actors, and artists, aspiring poets and scientists in training, committed community servants and leaders — in short, you are among the best of the best. We are richly blessed to have you as part of our academic community, and we look forward with anticipation to the many contributions you will surely make to Furman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning to the familiar, everyone, new or returning, can look forward to our Furman brand of academic rigor and the excitement (and perhaps a bit of the usual stress) of learning from our wonderful faculty who are dedicated to ensuring that each of you are as successful as possible. Our “Learning Success Center,” housed in the Duke Library and available to students, staff, and faculty alike, is almost unique in its span of experience and technology meant to further the success of each person. Finally, and thankfully, is the familiar beauty of the campus — the result of the hands of many, many people who take pride in Furman and in their work as a testament to God’s gift of beauty to all of us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a great year!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82b96",name:"Liberal Education is Dead",slug:"liberal-education-is-dead",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-08-28T04:00:14.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed61b",name:"Hammad Khan",slug:"hammad-khan",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["academics"],description:"Furman University as a liberal arts institution purports to embody liberal education - as pluralistic and holistic training of students to think critically. “Let a thousand flowers bloom” – a liberal arts institution must be a marketplace of ideas, of all ideas, to justify its theoretical commitment to liberal education.",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003ELiberal education is dead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman University as a liberal arts institution purports to embody liberal education - as pluralistic and holistic training of students to think critically. “Let a thousand flowers bloom” – a liberal arts institution must be a marketplace of ideas, of \u003Cspan style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"\u003Eall\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E ideas, to justify its theoretical commitment to liberal education.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Political Science department at Furman distinguishes itself through its strong faculty, departmental programs (internships, study away), and an affiliated leadership institute. However, the department’s over-arching approach to Political Science fundamentally contradicts the vision of a liberal education. In the United States, Political Science operates largely within a positivist framework – a framework which operates on an un-questioned ontological foundation – a foundation which is transcendent to scientific criticism, and consequently, presents itself as infallible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am well aware that this is an old and ongoing debate in graduate schools. For better or worse, this debate is, however, also pertinent, perhaps even more so, to undergraduate education. It is here, at the very latest, that students should be liberated from the socialization experience of their earlier years, an experience that all too often is, in fact, an unconscious indoctrination experience. It is here, at the latest, when they should be endeavored to become true liberal thinkers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the readers know, positivism assumes a scientific, objective and rational understanding of politics. It strives to achieve certainty – to produce (technically) useful ‘knowledge.’ However, positivism fails miserably in embracing such pronounced standards. Positivism assumes the given order as the natural order. The refusal to acknowledge ontological foundations as historically situated, fallible, and operative only within defined structures, results in liberal arts institutions, and the “knowledge” that they are perpetuating, to rest on assumed but not necessarily legitimate givens. Related, positivism fails to recognize the normatively-loaded elements of its already defined structures. As such, the much acclaimed positivist ideals of value-free and objectivity fundamentally give way to ideological structures that limit, rather than expand, political discourse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch built-in ideological bias serves to reify the existing (and all too often illegitimate) power structures. The positivist seeks certainty through describing as \u003Cspan style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"\u003Ethings are\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E. A liberal education ought to produce critical thinkers – critical thinking requires deconstruction and the distaste for dogmatism. As critical thinkers, it is our responsibility to not settle with how things are, but to ask: \u003Cspan style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"\u003Eare things\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E? Critical social theories, such as feminism, post-structuralism, and post-modernism, pursue such projects. Such approaches towards the study of politics are de-ontological, provide no exclusivist structures, and operate without a center. As a result, they fundamentally expand political imagination and discourse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPositivism, as the much-celebrated approach towards politics is fundamentally anti-intellectual through its remarkable lack of comprehension of the language of the oppressed – it speaks from a position of power eternally sidelining those as ‘irrational,’ who speak from a perspective of ethics, equality, and empathy. Contrary to the popular assertions, this is not disinterested scholarly professionalism; rather, it is active subservience to the hegemonic power structures. Being an academic, however, by definition, necessitates opposition to any hegemony as opposed to reifying or perpetuating it. The contemporary predominance of positivism in the liberal arts institutions requires intellectual \u003Ci\u003Esilence \u003C\u002Fi\u003Eon the ‘givens’ it presupposes - such silencing is the active marginalization of invaluable dissidence, through reinforcing all that needs no reinforcement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe practical manifestation of such ideological education is also evident in the various organizations and institutes prominent on many campuses, such as, the Riley Institute at Furman. Too often, these institutes seek out unreflective politicians as models for the students. Unsurprisingly and also unfortunately, those in power are held as ‘models’ for students, but not those intellectuals who embody moral distaste for (what is often illegitimate) power. Of course, such narrow ideological ‘educational’ paradigms are equally reflective in both the neo-liberal bend of economics departments, and the marginalization of critical theories such as any Marxist-inspired approach. That these are not outdated is very much demonstrated by the leftist critique emanating from the ongoing ‘ninety-nine percent’ debates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman University is chronically suffering from an ideological antithesis to liberal education. The failure to appreciate the value of a pluralistic and critical education - at a liberal arts institution is not merely a self-contradiction; but largely, is the final condemnation of liberal education itself. We, as an intellectual community which shares the commitment to pluralism, ought to “let a hundred flowers bloom,” and must not stifle the growth of any through ideological exclusivism. Our society could flourish best if we indeed let a thousand flowers bloom, and then pick the most beautiful. As it stands, we may never get to see the most beautiful.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82b5f",name:"The Importance of a Critical Patriotism",slug:"the-importance-of-a-critical-patriotism",timestamps:{published_at:"2013-04-15T04:00:30.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97743bc989e23628ed87f",name:"Ryan Blocker",slug:"ryan-blocker",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Discussions about patriotism often make me uncomfortable.

There is a saying that patriotism is having the belief that a particular spot of land is better than another simply because you were born there. I am inclined to agree that the concept is somewhat self-centered. Even so, I find that I still have patriotic feelings. However, I would not describe these feelings as unblemished. I am often critical of aspects of United States history and present-day social and political practices. To some people, this propensity for criticism of the country is an inferior patriotism. I would argue that the opposite is true.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people in the United States do not have the luxury of believing that the entirety of our nation's past was good. Frankly, to do so would require a bad memory. For example, one of the only reasons that we do not typically refer to the centuries of U.S. Native American policy as genocide is because it worked. Our government effectively erased generations of culture and history and displaced millions. Now many Native Americans live in unfathomable poverty and have little political and economic influence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the current political climate, gay, lesbian, and transgender Americans have their rights often subject to popular vote. These citizens have to cross their fingers and hope that courts and law makers view them as deserving of all of the rights of citizenship. They have to endure political discussions on the national stage that involve calling them deviant and being told by their representatives that their family values are inferior to those of bigots. These are legitimate criticisms of our nation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no good that comes from neutered telling of our history. Our country was founded on lofty ideals. The founders did not just read the great philosophers, but they modeled a nation after those ideas of liberty. To be frank, we failed miserably at first. All men were created equal if by men you meant exclusively males and then narrowed the definition further to mean land-owning white men. We championed freedom while enslaving a race of people. However, in a relatively short period of time, the descendants of those slaves went on to become congressmen, engineers, and secretaries of state. We expanded the definition of citizen to include women and racial minorities and they became Supreme Court justices. My patriotism lies in this more honest narrative.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, there is a lot of talk about patriotism and a return to what the Founding Fathers intended. It is important to remember that the U.S. Constitution was an evolving entity from the very beginning. The states would not even agree to ratify it without the addition of ten amendments. The framers built in mechanisms that allowed for it to change as our nation changed. It is perhaps most important for us to remember that the founders were not infallible and all of their intentions were not good. Being a black man, I have personally benefited a great deal from our nation's steering away from the original intentions of the Constitution. I am grateful for all of the amendments that had to be added in order to grant me the rights of citizenship. As a gay man, I am still waiting for the rest. If I have patriotism, it does not come from a narrative that says my country is perfect. It comes from a belief in the struggle to perfect it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"}],totalDocs:577,limit:25,page:20,totalPages:24,nextPage:21,prevPage:19,hasPrevPage:true,hasNextPage:true},pageTitle:"Opinion"},uses:{params:["category","page"],url:1}}],
