    <div class="description svelte-10sicl1">This news has re-heated an already hot sports debate on the idea of creating four super conferences in the NCAA. Everyone from sports analysts to coaches to television representatives and marketing agents have been discussing the possibility of creating four gigantic sixteen-team conferences as a means to push towards a legitimate collegiate football playoff system in an effort to generate even more money from a rabid fan base. To some of us these changes are more important than Greece’s floundering economy, war in the Middle East, and Obamacare.</div>

    <div class="description svelte-10sicl1">We’re told that the university appreciates things like “diversity,” “freedom of inquiry,” and the “freedom to look for truth wherever it is to be found.” But we’re also a university that “has sought to remain faithful to its Judeo-Christian heritage,” looked to hire professors evincing a “life of faith” and “sympathetic awareness of Furman’s traditions and purposes.” The statement that “Furman is a learning community where faith is cherished but not coerced” says it all.</div>

Students from kindergarten to their senior year stand up every morning and recite the Pledge of Allegiance, of which they have only the most dubious understanding, in a repetitive fashion that is totally not a form of brainwashing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the inviolable buzzwords we are conditioned to hold sacrosanct include liberty, democracy, and equality. We're brought up to believe that our vote does make a difference (it doesn't), that the government has our best interests at heart (they don't), and that anybody can make something of themselves (especially if you're a wealthy white male).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe're told that we have the most free country in the world, and we're told that our forefathers bravely and heroically fought against the forces of tyranny and oppression in the most just and necessary war for independence in history. But are we really so free? Is our bicameral Electoral College system really the best of all possible worlds? And, the main question I want to ask: is monarchy really so evil?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe here in the States tend to balk at any notion of increased central authority; this is one explanation for the resistance to a healthcare bill. Talk of monarchy is considered outlandish at best and seditious at worst. And yet, the royal wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton was one of the most highly-watched events of the year in this country.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat particular family is highly regarded in Britain and in all the commonwealth countries – though the Queen has very little de facto political power, her position is still highly respected, and she remains a cultural icon of the British people. In fact, her approval rating right now is at over 80% in the United Kingdom; compare that to the U.S. Congress's single-digit approval rating last month.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther developed countries with active monarchs include Denmark, where the royal family is adored (the queen even endorses a national ketchup brand); Spain, where King Juan Carlos has actually been very active in bringing about egalitarian reforms following the turmoil of the early 20th century and the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco; Sweden, which, along with Denmark, is one of the safest and most economically sound countries in the world; and also Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these countries are economically stable, culturally rich, and safe to live in.

Women exist in domestic ones: essentially, the home. Men are symbolized by the mind and think reasonably and logically. Women are symbolized by the body and are emotionally reactive. Men are the arbiters and creators of culture, where women are left with the natural world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt's not a secret that we live in a world where men are graded as superior to women, and there's nothing unique about a movie that reports the same thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, no one should be surprised that a film financially backed by rich heterosexual men about socio-politically elite heterosexual men is thoroughly patriarchal. We exist in a male-dominated capitalist heterosexual society: it's incredible that any film fights patriarchy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ides of March tells the stories of people behind Mike Morris' (George Clooney) campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Stephen (Ryan Gosling) is the junior campaign manager; Molly (Evan Rachel Wood) is interning with the Morris campaign in Ohio.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStephen and Molly are clear character foils. Both of them make major mistakes which could torpedo Morris' campaign. Both of them tell superiors that they've made a mistake; their superiors tell them that in this arena, you only get one chance. And then they veer in different directions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe dramatically discover that Morris impregnated Molly after the Iowa caucus. Stephen, who is having sex with Molly, finds out and helps her get an abortion. While Molly is undergoing her last act of loyalty to the campaign, Stephen is fired from the campaign by his mentor, Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman) for an unrelated case of disloyalty. Subsequently, he doesn't pick Molly up from the clinic. Molly takes some alcohol with her medication and dies; Stephen turns his fortunes around by using Molly's pregnancy as leverage. He blackmails Morris into firing Paul and making him the senior campaign manager.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo recap: Molly kills herself because she's a woman. Stephen survives and thrives because he's a man.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolly transgressed by entering the political realm. She would have done better to have left it to the men. Molly reacted emotionally to what she perceived as total abandonment. Stephen had, after all, fired her from the campaign and told her that the sex they were having didn't imply affection. Or perhaps we could blame her body. If she hadn't succumbed to the weakness of sexual activity, she wouldn't be so harshly punished for violating the rules.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStephen, on the other hand, transgressed when he gave in to emotion (only women do that). But when he takes a cold-blooded stand for his political life, he comes through with flying colors. As a man, he was born to play politics on and off the camera, and he takes advantage of Morris' bodily (read: womanly) weakness. By doing so, he ensures himself a high-paying, high-profile job.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, he overcomes any womanish tendencies to accede to a man's rightful place. If he loses his soul along the way, then that's the price he pays for not acting manfully throughout.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ides of March is just one film among many that falls into these simplistic binary traps.

Furman has some pretty good study away trips set up themselves that I would highly recommend - I have been on Fall in China and Spring in Edinburgh, in addition to the May by the Bay May X - but if you can't find one that suits your fancy, check out the affiliate programs as well, or even an independent student program. I've heard of great experiences from all of the above.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudy away is completely different from leisure travel, and in some ways, I contend, better. Rather than going about things from a tourist angle and with a generally limited amount of time, you are able to immerse yourself in the local culture and see how the people there actually live.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that a lot of people may not realize is that simply getting over that first hump of international travel - acquiring a passport - can sometimes be the most difficult part. Passports are expensive and require a lot of paperwork, and I am of the opinion that the first step is often the hardest: for example, I try to start writing some part of assigned papers at least a week or two in advance, even if I know it is mostly gibberish and will be greatly edited later.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that I have something from which to start building is enough; it makes that process so much easier as the deadline looms closer. Much as beginning to write is the first hurdle for me, acquiring a passport can be a huge obstacle for many.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEncouraging others to get out there, see the world, and educate themselves - and by providing them with necessary tools to do so - can foster hope and inspiration in us all.

Most of all, they are the first step.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, I encourage each and every reader to get out there and travel. As mentioned above, this can be a small step: perhaps, for you, travel encompasses looking a little more closely at downtown Travelers Rest. Maybe it's a day trip to Atlanta or Charlotte or Charleston. It could be a weekend spent in the Midwest or the Northeast, or it could be a whole week on a cruise or a hike near home or abroad.

The DH strives to offer many local and organic foods throughout the year, and they usually are accompanied by an identifying label. Last Thursday, I got to try many dishes that were new to me, all the while knowing that I was doing the environment a favor.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy go local? How do you find that? Well, aside from the DH, local food can always be found at farmers' markets, local produce stands like The Tomatoe [sic] Vine and sometimes even at grocery stores. Buying locally aids the environment by cutting down on the transportation miles needed to get the food from farm to table. Thus, less fossil fuel is burned, and your resulting food is usually fresher. Buying locally also boosts the local economy, making a real impact in our trying economic times.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the Eat Well program at Furman, the average head of broccoli travels 3,000 miles before reaching your plate. Furman defines local produce as that coming from South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. The USDA doesn't have a hard and fast definition for local food, so it's up to each consumer to define their individual tastes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so why organic? Isn't that expensive? Actually, that depends on what you're buying and from where you buy it. Organic crops are defined as that which are grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, ionizing radiation or genetic modification. Organic meats are raised on organic feed, are not given any hormones or antibiotics and have outdoor access. Organic food is therefore better for not only the environment and animals but also for the farmers and all consumers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally buy organic food whenever I can afford it - which, let's face it, is not always! But some non-organic foods that tend to have especially high levels of chemicals - the \"dirty dozen\" - are apples, celery, strawberries, peaches, spinach, imported nectarines, imported grapes, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, domestic blueberries, lettuce, kale, and collards. Many other foods are relatively safe, but I try to avoid buying non-organic versions of the above-mentioned foods. (Of course, eating any conventionally-grown produce is better than eating no fruits or veggies at all.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, back to the Dining Hall. I munched on cabbage collards, roasted eggplant, chard and bean soup and kale, but my favorite dish was the Exhibition Station's \"Crimson Lentils and Corn Maqu Chouxtopped with Grilled Tofu.\" The flavors really complemented each other, and they had Pete's on the side, which was delicious on the tofu (though probably not organic or local). Beverages provided included fresh, local apple cider and local, ginger ale-based watermelon mojitos - yum! There was also an info table near the salad bar where students could learn about the foods they were eating and where they came from, and as we've learned from G.I. Joe, knowing is half the battle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I alluded to earlier, I think that the DH always does a great job with providing local and organic dishes. They focus on serving seasonal vegetables, a practice that also aids the environment and is healthier for all involved, due to the increased freshness of the food. The chefs in our Dining Hall seem to enjoy creating ambitious and inventive dishes that, more often than not, turn out well and are a welcome twist on the classic pasta and sauce or sandwich, especially for a vegetarian like myself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe patience and amiability of the employees just adds to my campus dining experience. I appreciate the willingness of Aramark to work with Health Sciences and campus representatives to sponsor the Eat Well program, demonstrating their commitment to health and nutrition. Overall, though there is always room for improvement, I think that the DH and other campus dining services definitely have some good things going.

It took me a while to remember the Amnesty International flyers from last year, but I finally recalled the name. Troy Davis, an African American male, was sentenced to death in 1991. His crime was murdering a white policeman, Mark MacPhail, who was off duty.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem is that there is no DNA evidence to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt. They've never found a murder weapon, and the only evidence the prosecution possessed was 9 witnesses claiming his guilt. Since 1991, seven of the 9 witnesses have withdrawn their claims. So in sum, the accusations came from 2 witnesses and MacPhail's family\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot knowing any details about the Troy Davis case, I agreed to help lead the vigil. I felt very ill-equipped, like I was preaching at a funeral of someone I'd never met. When I went to meet my friends outside the library, I met colleagues prepared to fight injustice. They handed out flyers, passionately chanted rallying cries, and gave me statistics I had never dreamed of hearing. For instance, did you know that the U.S. has executed over 1,200 criminals since 1976? That according to the World Coalition, our country legally killed 46 people in 2010, and that this statistic puts us near North Korea, who killed about 60 people in the same time period? My international friends knew all of these stats. They knew the whole history of the case. And there I was, a native of the United States, a college student born to privilege, who would rather watch Glee than understand the injustice of our judicial system. I was ignorant of how any one of us, with the right prosecution, can be put to death for a crime we may not have committed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is it exactly that I want to convey? My point is that ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance makes us unaware of issues that really matter in the political life of our country. The implications of Troy Davis's execution are that it doesn't matter whether the justice system has hard evidence or not. If people want to convict us, if justice must be served, it can be served in truly proving our guilt. Ignorance also robs us of our duty to one another as human beings. If we are going to truly look out for one another and value our lives as much as the lives of others, then we must follow the words of Desmond Tutu: \"My humanity is bound up in yours.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are still millions of people in this country who know nothing about Troy Davis…will you be the one to help enlighten them?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82a8e",name:"Four Conferences to School Them All",slug:"four-conferences-to-school-them-all",timestamps:{published_at:"2011-10-10T04:00:14.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed56d",name:"Jeff Levene",slug:"jeff-levene",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"This news has re-heated an already hot sports debate on the idea of creating four super conferences in the NCAA.

As most of you are fully aware, the talk about playoffs in NCAA football has also been a buzz phrase for many college football fans. And I, along with most other enthusiasts, would agree that the sport needs a playoff system for an entirely fair outcome.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flaws of the basic bowl system were highlighted during the 2004 season, when University of Southern California was proclaimed national champions, even though both Southern Cal and Auburn had undefeated seasons and won one of the four major bowls. Some hoped that the 2007 addition of an official BCS championship game would help remove controversy, but Boise State proved this method had its own pitfalls, as Boise had several undefeated seasons, yet the team was not chosen for the title game because of their weak conference.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith four super conferences, each conference champion could have an automatic bid to one of the four BCS bowl games, now the first round of playoffs, while the other four openings would exist for the four other highest ranking teams. This would answer the prayers of football fans everywhere, because it means that could two Big 10 teams or 4 SEC teams could possibly have a shot at the title; or, Boise State could finally prove they are a national championship caliber program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I'm afraid the sight of playoffs has blinded us to some of the horrors a four super conference system could bring to the traditions of college football. Two years ago, it looked like the Big 12 was preparing to crumble as both Nebraska and Colorado left to join the Big 10 and Pac-12. Meanwhile, with the possibility of an apocalyptic end to the Big 12, schools still in that conference started frantically reaching out to anyone that would consider taking them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor teams not in super conferences, this system would be terrible. Like Boise's problem now, non-super conference teams would be belittled because of their \"weak schedule\" or the glorification of how difficult it is to play in the super conferences. Teams like Cincinnati or Iowa State could also find themselves in conferences far below their playing level. Also, basketball dominated universities, such as Kansas, might end up in small and otherwise unimportant hardwood conferences. I don't know about you but I would much rather see Kansas play Oklahoma and Texas every year as opposed to having an annual match up against Montana.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever my opinion, the recent ACC additions mentioned earlier has once again frenzied the Big 12 demagogues, who are once again predicting the conference's doom. And whatever happens, in the grand scheme of things, we should probably be more concerned with economic turmoil, a radical Middle East, or invasions by hostile aliens. But all the major changes in college football are a nice distraction from all the real world changes. So if you're flustered by the debt in Greece or Libyan revolutions, I suggest you turn on SportsCenter to get your media thrills and horrors.

But Brennan noted also that the mere existence of a motto like \"In God We Trust\" (or Christo etDoctrinae) is enough to create an atmosphere of \"religious chauvinism\" that the Establishment Clause exists to curtail.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, even though something like Christo et Doctrinae isn't actively vindictive or pernicious, its mere existence is potentially oppressive to those who do not believe in a Christ.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Furman plans to expand, no doubt to turn its strong regional reputation into a strong national one, we need to start expanding our appeal. We have spent two years considering global citizenship and spent the year before focusing on Asian Studies. These are good steps, but they're also transitory. Our motto, which speaks volumes to Furman's regional insularism, has stuck with us throughout and looks to be set for years to come. If we really want to start actively competing with universities whose (translated) mottos are things like \"Truth,\" \"Light and Truth,\" or \"The wind of freedom blows,\" a good place for us to start is emulating their stated foci.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre the opinions and diversities of people who don't fit into the normative scheme going to get swallowed up or be devalued simply because they're different?

Because happiness is fleeting and so particular in its sweetness, it requires such specificity that I have to accord writers who successfully achieve it a great deal of value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are those who may say that works exploring darker themes are what we need to read so as to explore our own selves, that somehow it is better for us as readers. While I can agree with the former, I believe that it is just as valuable to explore the heights our human emotions can reach. There needn't always be the archetypal fall to appreciate how great the top is. Because we experience countless trials, obstacles, and depressions in our lives, we value a work that shows more good than bad. While I can understand the cathartic attraction of reading a well-written portrayal of sadness or anger if the reader is feeling the unfavorable side of the human experience, is there not also a need for high quality portrayals of the brighter side to fulfill an emotional void? If one is indeed experiencing our previously established life-sucks-definition of the human condition, the human need for wish fulfillment would definitely benefit from the intake of literary positivity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am certainly not saying that the works we already respect and hold in high esteem should be less valued; I only wish to see more credence given to work that takes as its goal to in any way at all celebrate our human condition. That is also not to say that these works already exist in abundance. It may in fact be that so many authors are operating under the centuries-long conception that their work will be valued only if they explore some dark theme. Those authors who do write about more positive themes may get noticed, but it seems that usually they might hit the bestsellers list but then be sneeringly relegated to the fluff or sell-out pile by critics.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood, worthwhile writing does not have to delve into our dark sides or the events that drive us to dark places.

Are you interested in going to a fraternity house party? If so, you may be out of luck… unless you know a fraternity brother. Fraternity house parties have long been a part of Furman's Greek life and have provided a venue for social gatherings on the weekends. However, a recent change in the Inter-Fraternity Council rules has reshaped the way fraternities host parties.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, fraternities must submit a guest list 24 hours in advance of the party, and the fraternity is only allowed four guests per member. If there are more people that the fraternity wants to invite, there are 25 extra guests who can be included in addition to the four-per-member limit. This type of regulation is unreasonable. Previously, the rules concerning fraternity guest lists were more comprehensive, including all freshmen students, all members of Greek organizations, and a list of independent students that the fraternity wished to include. The former policy included many more students than the current rule allows. The new rule makes the guest list more restrictive and could be detrimental to fraternity-hosted events.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new rule poses a specific problem at Furman because unlike other universities, Furman usually has only one fraternity house party per night. If students want to go to an event at a fraternity house, they usually have only one option, compelling students to congregate at the same party. This has been beneficial in the past because it encouraged camaraderie among students. With the new rule, the guest list will be more confined, and students who are not on the list will have few alternatives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rule was changed because a national representative from one of the fraternities on campus alerted Furman that the university had been violating its guest list policy. The representative told Edward Young, Assistant Director of North Village and Greek Life, that the guest list policy should be changed in order to be in accordance with the risk management policy of the Fraternal Information and Programming Group.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the guest list policy now complies with FIPG regulations, it may put a strain on fraternities, as they must now turn students away who are not on the list. This could put the fraternities in a compromising position. No fraternity wants to turn people away from an event, especially during the fall rush season. This new policy is contrary to Furman's spirit of inclusiveness. For a freshman who might not know many upperclassmen, this could be a huge discouragement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequiring organizations to turn in a formal guest list prior to the event seems unrealistic. How could a complete and accurate guest list be formed that far in advance? Many students decide merely a few hours before an event whether or not to attend. It is also impractical to expect fraternities to send students home when they are given no resources to help them do so. There are no third party security personnel present at these events to help check the list and send students away; it is solely up to the fraternity. These measures do not seem feasible given that many more people might want to attend than the new guest list allows.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the new policy now complies with FIPG regulations, the guest list rule is an obstruction to the Furman sense of community, promotes exclusivity, and is simply not a viable solution for fraternity events.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82a6e",name:"Silent Consent",slug:"2414",timestamps:{published_at:"2011-09-26T04:00:09.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed561",name:"Tim Baumann",slug:"tim-baumann",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"One of the greatest manipulators of public opinion in American history proved his uncanny skill to do so with a single speech in late 1969.

What matters is that so many were quiet in the first place.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoliticians past and present float on a peaceful current of tacit approval. For ordinary citizens, tacit approval is a hand forcing their heads underwater.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of us probably don't realize the extent of our national silence. Our short attention spans and our belief in fundamental institutions mean that we rarely demand change or accountability. Did our blood boil because of Abu Ghraib? I doubt it. Amnesty International still condemns American POW camps in the Middle East. Were we shocked by My Lai? Not enough to care that only William Calleywas convicted of any wrongdoing in the massacre of Vietnamese civilians. Were we aghast because of our conduct in the Philippine-American War? Probably not. If you've heard of it, congratulations on being a history major.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe we were outraged briefly by the various war crimes undertaken by Americans. We've punished some names and strode on, patting ourselves on the back for being just. In the words of Colin Powell, these crimes \"are still to be deplored.\" Hating misdeeds is cute. That puts the breath of life back into the lungs of the 504 murdered at My Lai; it resurrects 1.4 million Filipinos whose deaths correlate to the Philippine-American War. Truly hating injustice doesn't mean condemning the past; those who hate injustices of the past work to ensure they cannot happen in the present or future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt's not as if the military is the only offender here, and it's extremely unfair (not to mention stupid) to pretend otherwise.

These are the ones that command attention on 24-hour news networks, the ones that have international ramifications. Then there are state scandals, there are municipal scandals. It isn't that the days of honest politicians who had their constituents' best interests at heart are bygone; it's that they never existed.

Forty-eight years from now, when LGBTrights are the norm (though to suggest that they'll be fully realized is to suggest that the rights of African-Americans or women are fully realized), your grandchildren will ask you how people could have failed to understand that sexual preference was unimportant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour answer will echo the answer of your grandparents' when you asked them how skin color could have mattered so much in their time. \"I don't know,\" we'll say (just like they did), \"but I should have spoken when I was able.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnow that to consent with silence is to side with power.

The brand \"Tyson Farms\" carefully markets rolling hills of countryside with peacefully grazing cattle. \"PET Milk\" – pet milk – peripherally connects us to our household animals. Their website features a nice red barn with three plump cattle in the nearby pasture. In reality, these animals are pumped with hormones, raised in cramped and unnatural quarters, and slaughtered at their physical peak.

I commend my peers for their efforts to do the right thing in the face of a cold, daunting \"real world;\" many of my good friends here are energetically pursuing careers more focused on making the world a better place than on making money, the latter of which many of us see as the chief vice of our parents' generation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the world can be a pretty difficult place to change most of the time. I can't count the number of articles I've encountered over the last few years that smashed my concept of what actually does make the world better. Whether it's an exposé on substance abuse among Peace Corps volunteers, or yet another sex scandal from some religious leader or other, or a report on corruption, bureaucratic bloat and mismanagement of funds in most NGOs, it often seems that any of these \"socially consciousness\" organizations are just pursuits of the wind. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExacerbating this problem is the tremendous pressure placed on those of us who, as Walter Kirnsuccinctly put it, \"have shown aptitude for showing aptitude.\" If you scored well on standardized tests, or were deemed \"above-average\" by some equally arbitrary standard, you were probably always assured that you were \"gonna go far,\" that you were special and had a specific purpose that you just needed to find, and once you did it would all be just perfect. One result of this is a proud mentality that makes us think we are too good for certain jobs; that's why trade school and apprenticeship enrollments in this country are the lowest they've ever been. When I casually mentioned to my mother that I was thinking about going to work on an oil rig to pay off my (quite significant) student debt, she asked me what the point of even going to college was if I was just going to \"waste my life in an oil field.\" I didn't have an answer for her. I lose a lot of sleep over my \"calling\" or \"purpose,\" and I have seen far too many of my friends sink into deep depression, become apathetic, and in one or two unfortunate cases, temporarily lose cogent mental ability, largely based on their inability to find this single purpose for which they were made.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur options, from our finite perspectives, seem very limited, and none of the ones we see seem to carry the potential we thought we were promised, that I dare say we feel entitled to. But the most important lesson I have learned from my time at Furman is a certain humility that comes from being constantly surrounded by brilliance. My mentality is changing. As most of the recent graduates of not only Furman but also of universities around the world are discovering, all those things you thought you were promised simply aren't there…yet. But what each of us can do, rather than worrying about making \"the world\" a better place, is simply to work towards making our world a better place.

However, I reread the Potter books faithfully every summer, and on my latest reading, I found a fun parallel that had previously escaped me. Order of the Phoenix is full of various \"Educational Decrees\" issued by the Ministry of Magic as that political body attempted to establish more control over Hogwarts School. These decrees are recommended by the newest teacher at Hogwarts, Dolores Umbridge; her qualification was her post as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic. Umbridge is quickly set apart from her fellow teachers through her standardized, government-approved curriculum, her close governmental ties, and her painfully dull classes. But within just a week of her appointment, a new Educational Decree is passed which gives her the ability to inspect the other teachers and assess their performance; later on, yet another Educational Decree givesUmbridge the power to fire teachers.

The press follows the government's lead slavishly.

American schools are being outstripped by foreign ones; schools are suffering from falling standards; teacher quality is the most important ingredient in school success, and ours is substandard. So No Child Left Behind was implemented enthusiastically by Congress and President George W. Bush's administration in 2001; Race to the Top was announced by President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan in 2009. The former manipulates with a stick, as punitive measures are taken against schools which fail to live up to its demands. That these schools are more often than not providing services to children living in some state of poverty (economic standing is the great correlative factor in academic achievement) is ignored. The latter uses a carrot; states that play the federal government's game of increased \"accountability\" and school choice are awarded with large sums of money.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEducation expert Diane Ravitch—the first person mentioned in this article who I can actually refer to as one— replied to the implementation of RTTT in the Los Angeles Times, saying \"Today there is empirical evidence, and it shows clearly that choice, competition, and accountability as education reform levers are not working…This approach may well make schools worse, not better.\" So just like the Ministry of Magic, the American federal government took steps to not just standardize what's taught in schools, but control it as well. Unfortunately, the government appears to have no idea what makes schools better.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat's most troubling to me are the comparisons we can draw between the fictional and the real fourth estates. The Daily Prophet takes cues from Fudge, reporting on some issues fawningly and completely ignoring others. Newsweek features a cover story on Michelle Rhee and gives Bill Gates an interview where they treat him as if his opinions on education are valuable or well-reasoned. \"The Colbert Report,\" of all things, takes time to be serious with Rhee and other would-be\u002Fknow-nothing reformers like Geoffrey Canada and John Legend. Those of us with a clue have to rely on op-eds by people like Diane Ravitch or the unfortunately late Gerald Bracey, who are hardly household names. The press should be the spark that inspires us to demand accuracy from our leaders, to ask pointed and incisive questions. Instead, they seem to be taking the politicians' words for granted.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI'm hardly making a direct comparison; after all, Umbridge was planted at Hogwarts to create a Ministry stronghold there while rooting out Dumbledore and his admirers, who were asserting the unpopular viewpoint that Lord Voldemort had been resurrected.

You will have to learn about many things while at Furman, thanks to the liberal arts curriculum. But one thing you will inevitably be faced with is the discovery of your Self.

Then you go to dinner at the DH with your best buddies from your first year at Furman and, by golly, they're serving falafel, your favorite DH dish!

Unfortunately, you will meet people that rub you the wrong way and call your ideas garbage. So when you find those people, what do you do? Do you engage in the match? Do you throw punches and say, \"It's my way or the highway?\" Or do you acknowledge the differences by engaging them in polite conversation? Do you realize that some battles cannot be won?

Transitional homelessness means that we're always growing and changing. Sometimes it feels like the things we believe are the only things that have some sort of stability.

They're a part of what defines you!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt's far too easy to engage in a game of bashing beliefs and opinions. Perhaps you've seen a religious group or two on TV protesting hot-topic issues with picket signs. Or maybe you were tuned into the Congressional budget debates a few weeks ago. You may have been disgusted by a lot of the sound bites being tossed around. Or you may be in agreement with them. The next time you find a group or another individual speaking about a particular issue, ask yourself these questions: Are they speaking with love? Are they speaking with humility and understanding, desiring nothing but to serve humanity in the greatest way possible? How am I reacting?

Voting, however, is a fundamental right, not a privilege. None of these other actions are similarly represented in our Federal Constitution by six different amendments. Our expansion of voting rights in the 20th century to women, minorities, and young people were historic steps in the right direction for our country, and these new voter ID laws are nothing but a step backwards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news (or bad news, depending on your perspective) is that because the state of South Carolina has a history of disenfranchising voters, the United States Department of Justice must pre-clear any changes to voting laws in the state.

Advocacy organizations in the state are now collecting personal stories and affidavits from those who do not have IDs, in order to show the Department of Justice that this law will unduly burden people in the state, preventing them from casting their ballot in future elections and practicing their Constitutional right to participate in our country's electoral system.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82a93",name:"The Book of Furmon (mispelling intentional)",slug:"the-book-of-furmon-mispelling-intentional",timestamps:{published_at:"2011-08-22T04:00:32.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed56d",name:"Jeff Levene",slug:"jeff-levene",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"This summer, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone moved their talents to Broadway with their Tony Award-winning musical The Book of Mormon.

I was pleasantly horrified, however, when I discovered that the musical's jokes were laced with philosophical questions about morality and faith, and even moreso that it attacks my own and many of my fellow students' life perceptions and quirks.

In the song \"You and Me (But Mostly Me),\" Price sings, \"Cause I can do most anything… cause Heavenly Father has chosen you and me, but mostly me\". While the song is obviously over the top, college students have a similar overexertion of their confidence. Whether it's fraternities and sororities attaching their names to charity events, student organizations bringing in public speakers to show off their power, or me writing this article thinking I have the power (or even right) to redirect our confident pride, we like to label charitable actions.

While Price's excited \"Donny Osmond\" style delivery of the story is flashy and exciting, the Ugandans see his efforts as self-righteous and ignorant. Meanwhile, in \"Making Things Up Again,\" Elder Cunningham cleverly shifts Mormon scripture to include real world problems like AIDS. Like Price, we often pity what we may deem less fortunate nations and insist that the American lifestyle is best for all, when instead, learning about foreign cultures and helping them with problems in new ways may be more effective and genuine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \"I Am Africa,\" the missionaries tell about their two-week mission in Africa.

And while our compassion and desire to connect with those in trouble are honorable emotions, some would suggest we have become enamored more with what some would call \"disaster tourism.\" Anderson Cooper, for example, has developed a saint-like appearance by being on the ground and saving lives in theatrical fashion with his in-the-storm reporting style. It almost amounts to a sick thrill in which we connect ourselves to tragedy and hard times. It makes us feel important, simply because we know about the tragedy. Whenever I watch a documentary or attend a moving CLP, I find myself adapting this elitist awareness, even though I have done nothing to help the problem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, Trey Parker isn't telling us to negate our acts of benevolence and kindness because of our poor motives, or to stop trying to make the globe a better place. As Price and Cunningham overcome their self-serving natures and become global citizens, Parker insists we too evaluate our motives so we can make a more meaningful difference. I encourage you not to let my pious opinion affect your perception of The Book of Mormon and suggest you check it out for yourself. Whether you fly up to New York to see the stage show, or just listen to some of the songs on YouTube, you'll be guaranteed some great laughs. But along with those laughs, you may just find a hilariously disturbing look at some of our quirks and faults, as well as motivation to push for a better tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82a92",name:"O-Week Is Just the Beginning",slug:"o-week-is-just-the-beginning",timestamps:{published_at:"2011-08-22T04:00:28.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed65d",name:"Lisha O'Boyle",slug:"lisha-oboyle",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:[],description:"Class of 2015, take it from someone who survived- you can come through your freshman year at Furman with a GPA still equivalent to the nation's gas prices.

And on top of that, some of the best memories you make during your college career will be during the O-Week activities that have been planned for your enjoyment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO-week is a whirlwind of names you'll have trouble remembering once classes start and trying to navigate the halls of Lakeside without getting lost. You will spend a ridiculous amount of money at the bookstore on a coveted\"FU\" t-shirt (along with other such items) and you will realize that everyone here talks in a code consisting entirely of acronyms (no worries though, you will soon learn all of them and become quite efficient in using them). But on top of all that, it is a time to make lifelong friends and jump outside of your box; a time to cultivate the person you want to be at this point in your life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one thing that everyone must come to realize about O-Week though. Yes, the activities you do may seem somewhat beneath you at the time; after all, you are now Furman students. However, going all out and participating in everything will make the first week you spend here at Furman something to happily look back on for the rest of your college career.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurman University: Off the Record quotes one student as saying, \"Furman is an incredible place to explore your calling and to find enjoyable people to join you on your journey.\" This journey starts the minute you step on campus and catch your first view of the picturesque landscape that our school is known for. Everything you do now will play a role in determining the path your life will take and who will be with you for the ride.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may sound cliché, but these first weeks you spend at Furman really will have a huge impact on the rest of your undergraduate years. So, be prepared to step out of your comfort zone. Give your opinions in class, talk to people you see in the DH, and most importantly, do not take this first year of freedom for granted. Four years may sound like a long time to make memories, but it will fly by; before you know it, you will be receiving your diploma.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreshmen class, you will receive advice from many people this year; sometimes solicited but more often not. Your RA's and FRAD's will be there to assist you through tough times and older classmates will give you tips on what professors to avoid. But most importantly, this year will give you the opportunity to find your own voice. This new found freedom comes with a price; yes, you are able to make decisions for yourselves now. Just remember that every action has a consequence, whether positive or negative.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two types of people in college: those who make the most of every minute of their four years and those who just coast along, content with simply being. Here at Furman, O-Week will play a large part in determining which category you will fall into. My advice for avoiding the latter group is simple: give 110% in everything Furman throws at you. Another cliché, I know, but it is actually applicable in this context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Class of 2015, relish these first few weeks at your new home, because they can provide a glimpse of how much you will enjoy these next few years of your lives. And one last tip- if you are not happy with how things look for you at the end of O-Week, don't stress. I have complete confidence when I say that over the next few weeks, you will realize that you made a great choice by coming to Furman University.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82a73",name:"Furman Trending",slug:"furman-trending",timestamps:{published_at:"2011-08-22T04:00:27.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed561",name:"Tim Baumann",slug:"tim-baumann",photo:null}]},categories:["opinion"],tags:["furmantrending"],description:"O-Week (UP)\nNew Bookstore (STATIC)\nFurman Football (STATIC)\nRemediation VLAN (DOWN)\nDoing Laundry (UP)\nBlack Swans (DOWN)\nMarching Band (UP)",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EO-Week (UP)\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt's like a sauna outside.
