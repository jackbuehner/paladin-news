Furman alumni will come to speak of their own experiences and help students plan for after college.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn years past, the session focused primarily on providing students with information on applying and attending graduate school. However, due to a change suggested by STD advisor Dr. Margaret Oakes, the session will now also focus on finding careers immediately after college.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Oakes, a similar successful session was held by STD last fall.

While in Wisconsin, Brown was covering a story on the union battles that were going on up there. In his interview with an anti-union protester who wore a button emblazoned with the adage “Don’t Trust the Mainstream Media.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the irony of someone like that agreeing to be the subject of his interview was not lost on Brown, he also averred that this grassroots activism and engagement is the best thing about American politics.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Although public perception is that partisan divide presents and insurmountable challenge to governing, there’s nothing wrong with partisan debate,” he said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Brown, the partisan divide is most polarized at the legislative level, though most Americans are moderate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrown offered some unique insight as to why this problem persists in American politics. “From my vantage point, the polarization is quite real. Compromise, these days, seems to be a dirty word,” he said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrown, who is also the arts correspondent for NewsHour, told the audience, which was made up of both students and members of the Greenville community, that in speaking to retiring members of Congress, he has learned that they do not want to return to Congress because of the ugliness that seems to dictate business there these days.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrown, whose 20 years at PBS have included work both behind and in front of the camera, was quick to add that he does not believe that people should completely let go of their beliefs. However, he emphasized that there are real problems in the country, and that solving these problems will require coming together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the age of new, interactive media, people get their news from an increasingly diverse set of sources. This is very unlike the situation half a century ago, when most Americans got their news from the three main broadcast networks. These days, people get their news from sources they agree with, he said. This, he believes, is where public broadcasting comes in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrown elucidated that the Internet Age is still young and we do not fully know the results or the outcomes of certain technological advancements. Brown used the young democracies in the Arab world as examples of the power that these new forms of traditional and social media have in influencing and shaping the courses that the world can take.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Now more than ever, our culture needs public broadcasting to put certain voices in the public arena. These are the voices that tell us about the world that we live in,” he said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese voices, he explained, were necessary to help society sidestep some of the narratives and stereotypes that we typically fall into.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsked about Brown’s assertion that Americans are not as divided as their representatives are, Jack Kowalski, a junior from Burlington, VT said; “I personally don’t agree. Some people see the America they know slipping away, while others believe that a new America is being ushered in. Both sides love this country dearly and are obviously very passionate about the direction they believe that the country should be heading in. This leads to Americans electing leaders that reflect their sharply divided values.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrown’s visit comes at a time where polarizing attitudes in congress has deeply affected performance and public perception. This 112th session of congress is on track to have passed fewer than half the number of bills that the second least productive congress has.

Maybe you’ve noticed fewer cars in the parking lots, a little less traffic on the way to class, the occasional unoccupied elliptical in the PAC. Maybe you’ve even found yourself pondering the pleasantly shorter lines in the DH (well, let’s not get too carried away).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of what you have or haven’t noticed, there has been a significant change involving the number of students in this year’s incoming freshman class: to be specific, about 91 fewer students than the previous year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore last year, the number of students enrolled in the Class of 2016 would be nothing out of the ordinary. The 717 new students making up the Class of 2014 is almost identical to this year’s 725 new students.

Admissions department plans to build on this to make the application process more \"holistic.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKelly said that this means Admissions is taking a \"bold and ambitious step toward telling the world, ‘We're interested in you as a student and member of the Furman community for reasons other than your SAT.'\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conjunction with this, much of financial aid will be reconfigured, though again, this will not affect current students' packages.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough Furman is academically rigorous, the school is not very selective. Recent applicant pools have been small in relation to the number of students accepted. The reason for this, Kelly said, is that prospective students tend to self-select.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the plan's biggest goals is to start attracting a consistently large applicant pool of 10,000 students per year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"Without a robust applicant pool, it's difficult to move forward and improve the quality of the university. The engine that drives the university is its reputation,\" said Smolla.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"Putting many more resources into admission is the key,\" he continued. These resources, he said, would lead to hiring more personnel, putting greater emphasis on marketing, creating more people-to-people connections, enhancing campus visits and using social media.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVision 2020 was authored by a steering committee consisting of 15 faculty, staff and students. The numerous ideas in the document came from the thousands of students, staff, faculty and alumni that the committee conferred with in various focus groups and surveys over the last year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan calls for the continued support for campus grounds and the music program. The university must build off what is already established, Kelly said. The university will never cede its academic strength, he added, for we are \"fortunate to have great, committed faculty.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"Your education is every bit the equal of what somebody is getting at Harvard, and in some ways better,\" said Kelly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Board of Trustees is expected to approve and endorse the plan when they meet October 27-29.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrategic plans are a regular part of the university's planning process and typically last for five to ten years. Furman's last strategic plan, adopted under President David Shi in 2001 and reaffirmed in 2007, included initiatives and improvements recently enacted in the sciences, sustainability and facilities. That plan, however, expired around the time of Smolla's inauguration.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"furmanpaladin",layout:"standard"},{_id:"61a9779dc9f3871ce8f82aa1",name:"Mrs. Christine, DH Worker, Dies at 74",slug:"mrs-christine-dh-worker-dies-at-74",timestamps:{published_at:"2011-12-14T05:00:36.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"61a97742bc989e23628ed579",name:"Sarah Hamilton",slug:"sarah-hamilton",photo:null}]},categories:["news"],tags:[],description:"Mrs. Christine \"Cricket\" Wehunt, a Furman Dining Hall employee, passed away on September 27, 2011.",photo_path:"",photo_caption:"",photo_credit:"Courtesy of Furman Athletics",body:"\u003Cp\u003EMrs. Christine \"Cricket\" Wehunt, a Furman Dining Hall employee, passed away on September 27, 2011.

Previously, she was the Assistant Secretary of Education and Counselor to Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander from 1991 to 1993 under President George H.W. Bush. She is also a popular blogger and has been the author or editor of over 20 books.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Furman, Ravitch spoke to over 250 people in the Younts Center. The audience included many students as well as local teachers, principles, superintendents, and educators.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn her keynote, Ravitch talked about the problems in the current American education system. She discussed the failures of the No Child Left Behind Act, an act she previously supported but now believes is the worst ever legislation on education.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe criticized reformers who believe that testing, accountability, and choice are the best formula for educational success. Teachers, she said, should not be solely held accountable for low scores.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"Education is not a competition or race, it is a continuous development,\" said Ravitch.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe stated her belief that relying solely on test scores only increases cheating, narrows education, and leads many districts to cut the arts, music, physical education, and any other classes that students are not tested on. Schools should be \"preparing students for life, not just a test,\" she said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERavitch talked about a recent trip she took to survey the public education system in Finland. There, she said, teaching is a great honor, and their teachers must apply to a very selective teaching program. The Finish language does not even have a word for \"accountability\"; the closest equivalent is \"responsibility.\" Because their teachers are so qualified, there is not a regulated curriculum, and the kids never see standardized tests until they apply for college.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer talk moved next to studies showing that poverty is the real problem, not poor educators. There is no testing program in the country that does not reflect family income. If we reduce poverty, Ravitch said, we will have higher test scores.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERavitch argued that good public education should be a right. \"A great nation needs a great education system.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiane Ravitch has turned down over 200 speaking engagements but accepted the invitation to speak at Furman because of Richard Riley, Former Governor of South Carolina and Secretary of Education under President Clinton.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"I want him to be a champion,\" said Ravitch. \"To speak up and speak out.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJill Fuson, manager of policy events for the Riley Institute, said she was very pleased with the outcome of the event. \"Anytime you have an event where students leave reflecting on the event, wanting to learn more, you know it's a successful event.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"Bringing people together around public policy issues is the goal of the Riley Institute,\" she added. \"[Ravitch is] an interesting person because she's been on both sides.
