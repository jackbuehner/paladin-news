Wheeler noted the administration wanted an increase in testing to “help track undetermined sources of underlying disease on campus.\" \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mandatory Sept. 4-5 campus-wide testing produced a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.furman.edu\u002Ffurman-focused\u002Fcampus-communications\u002Fseptember-7-2020\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E0.24% positive rate\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. According to Wheeler, this statistic could have possibly changed since “the value of a single test is limited to a single point in time.” With consistent testing, the administration can better monitor changes in the virus on campus. It can also improve contact tracing strategies should a cluster of cases develop. New sampling approaches and rapid results help ensure “Furman remains as safe as possible,” said Wheeler. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo existing evidence indicates an increase in COVID-19 on campus. Wheeler also added there are no “defined expectations” for an anticipated caseload after the random testing begins. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents responded to the testing in various ways. Junior Lauren Krotz said that she “didn’t mind the test since it only took a few seconds.\" &nbsp;Sophomore Mary Grace Cravens shared that her test also went quickly and was painless, even though she was not able to do a saliva test per her request and was instead “offered the nasal test.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother junior said, “This testing should have been done as soon as students got to campus,” although it is better late than never. They went on to question where funding for the tests is coming from. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWheeler concluded that the administration does not anticipate “a significant rise in asymptomatic disease” without corresponding changes in symptomatic cases. He also said visits to the health center, changes in LiveSafe responses, and contact tracers all work together “to paint a picture of health on campus.” According to Wheeler, no single variable is considered to the exclusion of others when it comes to Furman’s COVID-19 response. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents should continue completing their daily LiveSafe health survey and must report to testing if selected. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdbe3",name:"Furman Admissions Resumes Tours, But Loses Ambassadors",slug:"furman-admissions-resumes-tours-but-loses-ambassadors",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-09-30T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc62",name:"Owen Kowalewski (Provisional)",slug:"owen-kowalewski",photo:null}]},categories:["news"],tags:[],description:"Admissions plans on resuming in-person tours, many Ambassadors do not plan on giving any.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5f74cb7ce44e670867d4d572_campus-gates-1140.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"While Admissions plans on resuming in-person tours, many Ambassadors do not plan on giving any.",photo_credit:"Furman News",body:"\u003Cp\u003EIn a Sept. 25 email, Furman University Admissions announced their intention to resume campus tours for prospective students and their families. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmissions Ambassadors President, senior Madison Hurst, was disappointed that students were not consulted. “We didn’t decide,” she said, clarifying that no students or ambassadors were asked for their input. Hurst initially learned about Admissions’ intentions on Sept. 9, before second and third years returned to campus. She recalled thinking that Admissions presented the situation as “something already decided” and not up for debate. Though she tried to speak up and voice her concerns, Hurst felt that her discussion with Admissions was more of a formality rather than a genuine consideration for how prospective students taking in-person tours might impact campus health. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Furman moves forward with the new policy, touring students will not have access to certain areas of campus and the tours will be entirely outdoors on trolleys. Prospective students and their two guests cannot enter any academic buildings or residence halls. Despite the precautionary measures, Hurst noted that Admissions already has a program on the app Guidebook, which allows prospective students to tour campus from their car. This could serve as an alternative to ambassador-led tours as it allows prospective students and their families to see the campus without directly interacting with, and “possibly exposing students to COVID,” according to Hurst. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Abby Magoola, who is a member of Mosaic, a student organization that assists in the recruitment of multicultural prospective students and is also affected by these policies, the health of the students and faculty should be our top priority.

Students and faculty have had to adjust to this new, restrictive environment, but few have considered how another important part of Furman, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI), has had to adjust to current circumstances. The Furman OLLI program, operating since 1993, allows adults 55 and over to continue learning into their senior years. Director Nancy Kennedy shared many of the changes OLLI has faced in the last few months. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOLLI currently offers courses in math, history, life sciences, political science, and more. According to Kennedy, the current COVID-19 model greatly changed OLLI’s day to day operations. Notably, the program became fully virtual, requiring over 1,000 senior citizens to quickly adapt to Zoom and its processes. Kennedy said this transition was not easy, noting “Zoom is second nature to most Furman students,” but some OLLI students struggle with getting in to the first Zoom meeting. &nbsp;Kennedy added that after their first virtual meeting, the majority of OLLI students adjusted to the virtual environment and had little trouble in the following meetings. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround 400 programs like OLLI exist across the country, 144 of which are OLLI branches. These senior learning programs help contribute to senior citizens’ general well-being. OLLI at Furman has become widely popular. Kennedy mentioned that senior citizens \"will retire in Greenville because of our program.\" OLLI classes provide academics without requiring assignments, tests, or grades, creating a relaxed learning environment that also serves as a social opportunity for the students. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKennedy noted many OLLI students were originally hesitant towards the transition from in-person to virtual classes but are now embracing the new method of learning. According to Kennedy, although students cannot be on campus, virtual instruction was “better than nothing, and it was still fun.” Despite not learning in person, OLLI students can still enjoy their book clubs and other similar activities. Kennedy celebrated that over 1,000 senior citizens became comfortable with the virtual learning environment. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKennedy stressed the importance of maintaining OLLI’s social impact during COVID-19. She mentioned that “the classes have almost become secondary to the social obligations that [OLLI students] have made.” Many OLLI students took advantage of their new technology skills and now use virtual platforms to communicate with friends. Kennedy added, “When OLLI held orientations, I would do office hours and some [students] would love to just come in.” Kennedy emphasized the value of social interaction for OLLI students, especially given the current circumstances. She concluded that simply providing the opportunity to say, “hey, how are you?” is the best thing that OLLI can do for its students. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb0e",name:"Exclusive Interview with President Davis",slug:"exclusive-interview-with-president-davis",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-09-26T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df7c4f59fe1d47b0621616",name:"Lauren Krotz",slug:"lauren-krotz",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Flauren-krotz-2021-03-21.jpg"},{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc4a",name:"Evan Myers (Provisional)",slug:"evan-myers",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets-global.website-files.com\u002F5f37fcdc1b6edd6760ad912f\u002F5f4814aa2c3763ecb38ec309_5f418ff6e903f235ac41e277_EVS.jpeg"}]},categories:["news"],tags:[],description:"The Paladin’s Editorial Board met with President Elizabeth Davis via Zoom to discuss students' burning questions about Furman’s future.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5f6ee4acd8a231be518312df_Elizabeth-Davis-1140-1.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"President Elizabeth Davis is leading Furman through the COVID-19 pandemic.",photo_credit:"Furman University",body:"\u003Cp\u003EOn Sept. 23, members of The Paladin’s Editorial Board met with President Elizabeth Davis via Zoom to discuss some of students' burning questions about Furman’s future.

Currently, 300 students are learning remotely for the entire fall semester and while the administration does not anticipate having to be fully virtual in the spring semester, students will again have the option to learn virtually. Tom Evelyn echoed President Davis’s statement about the unlikeliness of drastic change before the spring and agreed that the spring semester could be very much like the fall. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMandatory COVID-19 vaccines are a possibility. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EPresident Davis said that requiring all students to get a vaccine if one were to come out is not out of the question. She understands that people may be reasonably skeptical, but if a safe vaccine were to be released to the public, Furman would attempt to make the vaccine free and accessible to all students. Evelyn added that a vaccine would be a “small component in the efforts to keep the campus safe,” adding that additional measures would continue to be adopted by the University to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EZoom is here to stay. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EPresident Davis explained that moving forward, as students become increasingly familiar with Zoom and similar platforms, access to Furman will be broader and more flexible. It is her hope that these platforms will allow students to stay connected to the classroom and pursue various opportunities on or off campus. Some professors have noticed that certain students have thrived in the new learning environment, but in the long-term, she does not believe Furman will become an “online college.” As for the new technology installed in the classrooms, Furman plans to continue using it beyond COVID-19. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFurman still values its residential campus. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EPresident Davis underscored the importance of an in-person college experience.

She also noted that student organizations can request meetings with her office. Evelyn added that another avenue for communication between the student body and the administration are the Ad Hoc Committees, such as the Ad Hoc Committee Taskforce on Black Life at Furman, that have been created to amplify the student experience. There are no plans, however, to create a platform for the rest of the student body to share their thoughts with administrators. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIt is hard to be President in a pandemic.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E President Davis reminded \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ethat throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, she has had to make several difficult decisions. “Anything that affects people’s lives is a hard decision,” she said, adding that even if the decision might be the obvious solution, the consequences can still be hard.

From virtual city council meetings, mask ordinances, and hybrid public school models, the city has implemented many adaptations this year.

Throughout college, Pittman became inspired to create an algorithm that allows people to erase tweets that may eventually cause a roadblock during the job application process. According to Pittman, cancel culture is at an all-time high, and “our society is very unforgiving.” Pittman knows that job candidates do not want to have any old social media posts pose as obstacles while starting their careers, so he decided to create a solution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a candidate applies for a job, the employer will often perform background checks on each applicant.

Levine was able to offer valuable insight, given that he serves as an elections integrity fellow at Alliance for Securing Democracy, The German Marshall Fund of the United States. When asked what Levine &nbsp;considers to be the biggest threat facing American democracy, he indicated two issues: one being foreign interference in our elections and the second being the lack of confidence voters have in the election process. According to Levine, “voters are concerned about bad actors’ interference in elections... can we say everyone has access to voting, and can a large portion of the population have confidence in election results?” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMail-in voting has been a hot topic recently, but Levine assured that mail-in voting security has been a priority since the Civil War. Many advancements have been made, such as ballot tracking technology and barcodes that prevent counterfeits. Levine said, “the system as a whole is secure, but the question lies in the implementation.” He noted that Covid-19 will certainly increase mail-in voting, so voters should be diligent in ordering their ballots and checking the status of their ballot after it has been mailed. Regarding concerns with mail-in or absentee voting, Levine suggests a solution to this growing concern: “Be able to explain it or walk people through how it works. If a voter can validate their choices that is an important piece. Have a strong chain of custody protocols. Have a process following election day that can validate results. Give voters the opportunity to verify election results themselves.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevine also pointed out some problems in the American voting procedure: “Having a decentralized election process can be an asset, but the flipside is that we have jurisdictions with much less resources than others in terms of money, staff, etc. Every single jurisdiction needs the tools and funds and resources needed to secure their elections.” Levine also pointed out the threat of disinformation as people, especially prominent figures in society, talking about elections in a misinformed manner. The spread of misinformation may be used by foreign adversaries who, according to Levine, can take a piece of false information and dissipate it widely. Levine also suggested modifications like data backups for voter registration systems, such as paper poll books, in the event that something electronic goes wrong during an election. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen asked to comment on President Trump's suggestion to “check the mail-in voting systems,” Levine suggested voters “seek out trusted sources, such as local and state officials, when they have questions about [the] election.” He then added to use those sources to make a voting plan, which includes forming your own opinions and knowing if, where and when you can early vote. “It’s important to remember a lot of places will be offering early voting” Levine said, indicating that getting a head start is not a bad idea. Not only does voting early help the election officials, but it also helps from a public health standpoint. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding potential voter trends in the upcoming election, Levine suggested that it is hard to know for sure, but he is “hopeful that lots of people turn out to vote...and there is reason to believe there will be a large turnout, as there is a lot at stake.” &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven Furman’s recent accolades as a politically active campus, we wanted Levine to speak about the importance of college students being informed and heading to the polls. Levine advises experts may need to “Build trust, meet voters where they are. Walk ‘average’ voters through the process and arm them with the information about what may be threatening their vote.” He pointed out that individuals hold visions for what is wanted in this country, “but you can't complain if you don't participate.” It is important for students to stay informed about voting and to seek out trusted sources when they may have questions. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevine stated that “Civic education prevents the spread of misinformation,” which would help resolve the problem of low political efficacy. Levine went on to add, “within election interference, you need a whole of society approach.” According to Levine, we need media organizations that understand how elections are run and ones that share correct information about voting procedures in a timely manner, as voters need to know where they can find reliable information. He concluded that “Our elections have gotten more secure, but the spread of misinformation threatens efficacy.” &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned for Straight Talk Session 3 on Sept. 15.

The figure currently stands at 49 cases. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Dashboard shows that 13 on-campus students were tested since Sept. 7, resulting in 8 positive cases. The utilization of on-campus isolation and quarantine spaces remains at 7%, but the number of students in quarantine on campus has increased to 16. This suggests that some students are be allowed to quarantine in their dorms or apartments rather than being forced to move into a separate, isolated quarantine dorm. Although only 6 students are currently quarantining off campus, this does not reflect the second- and third-year students who tested positive for COVID-19 prior to returning to campus between Sept. 11-13 and are still at home. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to updating the dashboard, Furman informed community members that among all of the returning second and third year students who were required to take a PCR test prior to moving in, there was a 1.4% positivity rate.  This positivity rate is significantly higher than the 0.024% rate observed among on-campus students (mostly first-years and fourt-years) after campus-wide tests on Friday, Sept. 4.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdministration officials previously shared that the University is monitoring “critical guidelines from CDC, SC DHEC, and our on-campus clinicians and health experts,” and this week’s Dashboard update featured Greenville County disease metrics reported by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC).

While there are still opportunities for community members to take advantage of the facilities, many students have been surprised and disquieted by the significant decrease in access to certain areas of the PAC. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result of COVID-19 protocols, the PAC’s new hours are 7:00am-9:00pm on the weekdays, closed on Saturdays, and 12:00pm-7:00pm on Sundays, exclusively for students. While this seems like a normal gym schedule, students quickly learned that from 8:00am-5:00pm on Monday and Wednesday, and 8:00am-4:00pm Tuesday and Thursday, students who are not in a “Wellness Concepts” class, will only have access to the new Auxiliary Fitness Center in the former basketball gym, and not the upstairs weightlifting area. Although it is not in the original space, this new center has almost all the same aerobic equipment found in the other areas of the PAC. According to the Director of Campus Recreation Owen McFadden, “the [downstairs] gym itself can handle the return of second- and third-year students” based on how little the newly modified area has been used by students during the day. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PAC’s main concern for the return of second and third-year students is the upstairs weightlifting area. According to McFadden, it frequently reached its 20-person limit with just half of the student body on campus. Returning students should anticipate a wait time to use the upstairs area, which is especially popular from 4:00pm-6:00pm on weekdays. McFadden also noted that a PAC employee is always monitoring the upstairs area to ensure that the 20-person limit is followed. Given the popularity of the upstairs area, students may need to change their usual workout schedule, or be more flexible with wait time. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis decision to limit second floor access during the day has caused disappointment, given that, it is normal for Furman students to have several commitments in the afternoons and evenings, such as extracurriculars, labs, or study sessions. “I understand the need to have the facility cleaned and everyone distanced,” said freshman Kate Gildart, “but it’s difficult to find time in the day to actually go when I don’t have class or something else.” &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMrs. Kelly Frazier, a lecturer and Faculty member in the Department of Health Sciences, also weighed in on the COVID-19 changes and helped explain why they had to be made. “I can completely empathize with [the] expressed concern [from the students],” As part of the Wellness Concepts curriculum, students are required to exercise during two classes each week. With the new COVID-19 social distancing guidelines, the PAC capacity has been limited and equipment has been rearranged. Given that Wellness Concepts is a required class, the decision to reserve areas of the PAC for Wellness students during the day was critical. According to Frazier, without these regulations, “it would be difficult for staff to maintain distancing guidelines.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those looking to change their usual workout schedule, there are several opportunities for students to move their routines elsewhere. According to Frazier, there is now a “partner[ship] with CHAARG to offer outdoor exercise training sessions…and FIT Rx trainers (HSC majors) …providing free individualized exercise training and health coaching.” The PAC is also hosting Zumba and yoga classes in the dance studios free of charge. And as always, all of the trails, city parks, and Paris Mountain State Park are accessible. “Interestingly, exercising outdoors in nature has been associated with improved physical and mental health—and it will likely reduce the spread of COVID to keep everyone safer” according to Frazier. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the summer, two safety committees have been working closely with the University and the PAC to plan how these health and safety procedures will be carried out in the coming months. With second- and third-year students returning to campus, student traffic in the PAC will significantly increase. Students are required to wear a mask and must also bring their own water bottle as water fountains remain unavailable. The touchpads at the entrance have also been taken off-line, so students will always need their Furman IDs to enter the PAC. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb94",name:"Former Bob Jones Student Sues Furman and Bob Jones for Mishandling her Sexual Assault Case",slug:"bob-jones-student-accuses-furman-football-player-of-sexual-assault",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-09-08T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc4d",name:"Hailey Wilcox (Provisional)",slug:"hailey-wilcox",photo:null}]},categories:["news"],tags:[],description:"On Aug. 5 a former BJU student filed a lawsuit for negligence, gross negligence, and recklessness, as well as negligent hiring, supervision, retention, and interference with a contract.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5f57c45d293f294b6da651c4_FUPO.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"The lawsuit also alleges that Whitfield, one of the responding FUPD officers, acted out of line in reporting the drinking to BJU.",photo_credit:"Furman University",body:"\u003Cp\u003EOn Aug. 5 a former Bob Jones University student filed a lawsuit against Furman University, a Furman University football player, the Furman University Police Department (FUPD), Trevor Whitfield from the FUPD, and Bob Jones University (BJU) after claiming negligence and recklessness in the handling of her filed sexual assault case.

Roe did, however, receive a sexual forensic exam. Following the events, Jane Roe was expelled from BJU for violating the University’s alcohol policy. She filed the lawsuit alleging negligence and recklessness and is requesting a jury trial for monetary damages. The lawsuit also alleges that Whitfield acted out of line in reporting the drinking to BJU, given that Roe had reported a sexual assault and had expressed concern of possible expulsion if BJU found out about the drinking. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to court documents, Roe states that upon receiving word from former officer Whitfield, Deneen Lawson, Dean of Women at BJU, went to the hospital in an attempt to speak with Jane Roe only to find out she had already left.

Without a formal investigation, Roe was expelled from Bob Jones University the morning following the alleged assault. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the lawsuit, Furman Title IX coordinator Melissa Nichols said that although she is not able to discuss specifics of the ongoing case, “[Furman] wants all students, employees, and visitors on campus to feel comfortable reporting sexual misconduct.” Nichols emphasized that “[Title IX] has a thorough and thoughtful process that provides multiple options for reporting and adjudicating such cases, and I can promise you that we follow up on every report.” Without giving specific details on the case, Nichols can tell that “the facts are, as is often the case, more complicated and nuanced than what appears in news coverage and other publicly available sources.” Nichols also reminded that a Furman student who reports sexual misconduct or is a witness in a sexual misconduct matter would not be disciplined for drinking underage if that information came out during the sexual misconduct report or investigation. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChief Milby from the Furman University Police Department said, “Details of the night in question are part of that litigation, and therefore even though they are not going on currently, I cannot comment on them.” Although he was not able to offer details he did remark\u003Cem\u003E \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ethat [FUPD] expects all officers to uphold the values of the police department and University.

What has changed now is that we do have evidence of the disease in the sense of a formal outbreak from an off-campus event that approaches a 60% positive COVID-19 test rate.” In sum, Wheeler agreed that the administration would likely not be doing campus-wide testing if it weren't for the parties at the former Kappa Alpha fraternity house and the subsequent outbreak. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the mandatory campus-wide tests, however, Wheeler suggested that the administration has no reason to suspect that there is high caseload on campus. He cited that, besides cases linked to parties at the former Kappa Alpha house, there “have been less than 5 cases on campus” that have been tracked and followed by the health center since August 12.

Wheeler indicated, for example, that among the students in attendance at the off-campus house parties, the ratio of students living off campus to those living on campus was highly significant (there were a lot of students from off-campus). “One concern,” he emphasized, “is with those students who may be coming from off-campus who have not all been quarantining or following the Paladin Promise.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Wheeler, the success or failure of Furman’s policy response is contingent on students’ cooperation.

We are doing everything we can to limit contact between custodial staff and folks on campus,” Benes explained. “We want to maximize distancing and minimize contact as much as possible.” One such adjustment was reducing the frequency of office cleaning. The custodial staff now focuses heavily on classrooms, restrooms, and other frequently touched surfaces. The faculty have assisted in this effort by maintaining the department spaces between weekly cleanings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to reducing contact with other members of campus, Furman gave the custodial staff personal protective equipment and CDC-approved disinfectants. Although many staff members are nervous about COVID-19, they are happy to contribute to the health of the community. “They love Furman and want to do what they can to keep it safe,” Benes shared.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite recent violations of the Paladin Promise resulting in several positive COVID-19 cases, Benes applauded the student body for their hard work “complying and doing what they’re supposed to be doing, which we really appreciate.” The custodial staff has placed hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in each classroom for student and faculty use. “Keep doing the right thing, wear your masks, and help us out a little by wiping down the shared surfaces,” Benes said. “The biggest thing is keeping you here on campus, and we all want our community safe and healthy.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb7a",name:"A Series on StraightTalk: Voting In America",slug:"a-series-on-straighttalk-voting-in-america",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-09-04T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc48",name:"Emma Berger (Provisional)",slug:"emma-berger",photo:null}]},categories:["news"],tags:[],description:"The Riley Institute is excited to host this three part-series given the upcoming election, and The Paladin will continue to cover the events in a news section mini-series.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5f529a5188b112273230b803_straighttalk-landscape-graphic.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"Throughout September, Furman’s Riley Institute is hosting a three-part series called “StraightTalk: Voting in America,” alongside the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) and South Carolina ETV.",photo_credit:"The Riley Institute",body:"\u003Cp\u003EThroughout September, Furman’s Riley Institute is hosting a three-part series called “StraightTalk: Voting in America,” alongside the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI)\u003Cem\u003E \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eand\u003Cem\u003E South Carolina ETV. \u003C\u002Fem\u003EThe first session came on Sept. 1: Lurching Forward: 244 Years of Fighting for the Right to Vote.

Many second- and third-year students have already booked hotels or flights to Greenville and are now scrambling to get tested before they move in. Junior Lindsay Diehl said, “I do think every student should be getting tested. However, this is a very late and unorganized decision that should have been thought about earlier.” Diehl, who lives nearly 12 hours from Furman has already booked a place to stay on her way down, so she must get tested quickly in order to get her results back before her intended departure.

Kalau added, “When Furman released the Paladin Promise, testing should’ve been listed as necessary for return to campus, they messed up and now they are having to fix it.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreshman Baxter Easley, who is already on campus, told \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin “\u003C\u002Fem\u003EWhile I am not happy about [the decision], I think testing is necessary based on the actions taken by particular groups within the student body that have violated the Paladin Promise and jeopardized the health and safety of the campus community.” Another freshman, Jace Gravitt, added “I mean it’s really just a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things. As long as this helps us stay on campus, I support it.” &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, students seem generally supportive of the University’s decisions to begin testing but sharply critical of the way the University came to that decision.

The proctor then paused the scene and opened the Zoom chat for discussion. This prompted an attendee to declare that “white people built America so we should be the ones to run it.” This was the first of many upsetting comments made by students in attendance. Other comments implied that an attendee did not believe the U.S.’s involvement in the genocide of Native Americans was real, and that rioting discredited the Black Lives Matter Movement. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany students expressed their disappointment in these triggering comments. Freshman Kayla Moses pointed out, “This school has a history of blatant bigotry, and I expected it when I got here.” &nbsp;Moses further explained her frustration with a white male proctoring the session about social inequality, saying it made the conversation unsafe and unproductive. &nbsp;Freshman Kevin Carberry also commented on the interaction saying, “It gave racists and bigots a platform [and] a way to voice their hurtful opinions to our whole class.” Carberry noted, “The intention [of the Zoom meeting] may have been good, but it was handled in such a way that these people were able to hide behind a screen and spew hate.” Carberry shared that the comments made him feel sad, angry and quite frankly terrified that these hateful beliefs live on campus. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second scripted discussion centered around the LGBTQ+ community. The scene focused on a young person being forced to come out as non-binary while being verbally attacked by their roommate. The conversation that followed caused the Zoom chat function to explode into chaos. One student loudly played ‘Mo Bamba’ by Sheck Wes over the speaker, while another student repeated, “there are only two genders.” This prompted a discussion about the validity of the transgender community after the proctor removed a student for saying, “it’s pretty self-explanatory, I was born with a **** between my legs.” &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome students in the chat were outraged over the claims made to invalidate the trans community, as there was little guidance from the proctor. Several students complained that every chat participant was able to speak freely over one another, which according to freshman Colby Feigenbaum “created a huge disarray and much of the conference was spent listening to students yell at each other, as well as shout closed-minded, offensive things.” Feigenbaum believes that the Zoom session served only to further divide students as opposed to its goal of unifying them through conversation. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, the goal of the \u003Cem\u003EYou.

There was little time to hear the thematic material over certain students’ hateful words. &nbsp;In response to the conference, freshman Isabella Horton remarked, “the lack of moderators or people to hold students accountable for the words said was so unexpected. There was no real teaching that went on.” Horton believes the Zoom session threw topics at the student attendees and expected that to simply educate them. Rather than the proctors or moderators minimizing interruptions, “we were the ones who had to hold our fellow students accountable [and] call them out for the misinformed and uneducated things they were saying,” claimed Horton. She concluded, “It was a burden to put onto these students, especially students of color and the LGBTQ+ community, to try and educate their peers.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the zoom misconduct, the Director of the Center for Inclusive Communities (CIC) Deborah Allen, told \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ethat while the first incident involved an attendee using a pseudonym, the second incident was reported on the LiveSafe app and a bias incident report has since been submitted.

She concluded, “We have much work to do at Furman in terms of cultivating an environment that is truly inclusive for our underrepresented community...[it] will take education, accountability and long-term systemic changes for us to make a lasting impact.’’ \u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdbf9",name:"SGA President at the Center of COVID-19 Controversy",slug:"sga-president-at-the-center-of-covid-19-controversy",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-08-31T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60fb5ac88903ad2774afdc6b",name:"The Paladin News Team (Provisional)",slug:"the-paladin-news-team",photo:null}]},categories:["news"],tags:[],description:"On Aug. 21, Mills failed to live up to the very policy for which he has been the figurehead.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5f4d124032cef06dc98b4761_griffin-512x341.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"Student Government Association (SGA) President Griffin Mills is the face of The Paladin Promise, the social contract at the center of Furman University’s COVID-19 response.",photo_credit:"Furman University Website",body:"\u003Cp\u003EStudent Government Association (SGA) President Griffin Mills is the face of The Paladin Promise, the social contract at the center of Furman University’s COVID-19 response.

According to his account, he sat on the porch with a mask on for the entire night and hardly noticed as the gathering grew into a party of 15. Ultimately, he concluded, “it was just bad circumstances… I am human, I made a mistake. It wasn’t malice, it literally just happened.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne week following the event, on Friday Aug. 28, Mills informed the student body of his “immature actions” from the previous weekend in a statement posted on the @FurmanSGA Instagram page. Notably, Mills only chose to be transparent with the student body that elected him after \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E contacted him about their knowledge of the story and intention to run a piece on Wednesday Aug. 26 at 3:30PM. Initially, in fact, Mills responded to \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin\u003C\u002Fem\u003E’s request for a comment by saying, “I don’t want you to include my attendance there because it's a lot more complex than that.” &nbsp; \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Mills announced the news, some students have already begun to cast doubt on his telling of the evening. When asked if he believes Mills’ account, one Furman senior answered “Absolutely not. Having lived in North Village, I think it would be impossible not to notice that there were so many people inside of an apartment.” The student clarified, “I think it is important to give people grace and second chances, but he is the SGA President and should be held to a higher standard.” &nbsp;Another Furman senior who is currently in quarantine questioned why Mills is “so quick to stay in touch with the student body via email yet posted his apology on the SGA Instagram account with a mere 1000 followers?” She concluded, “Seems like a cop out to me.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs students have taken to the comments section of the @FurmanSGA post to either call for Mills’ resignation or commend him for his honesty, Mills has continued to emphasize that he does not plan on resigning and is “more committed now than ever to being the person that can lead us through this.” He claims that he has learned his lesson and wants to encourage students that “we can’t be passive if we want to stay safe. We actually have to try.” Mills went on to explain that the student body has become “much more divided in the past few days” as student-reporting of Paladin Promise violations has led to “people feeling attacked and upset.” Mills concluded that it is important for students to understand what they “can do because they have been told so often what they can’t do,” summarizing that “it can’t go on like this, people are just not feeling welcomed here.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Mills drew a sharp distinction between his situation and the parties that occurred at the former Kappa Alpha Fraternity house on the same weekend, describing the events as “complete opposites.” Mills elaborated “that there just happened to be more than eight people in an apartment is not the same thing as a deliberate party with underage kids and people who were from on and off campus.” &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn sum, Mills seemingly wants students to “stay focused that we’re in this together” in two important ways: first, by following the Paladin Promise and foregoing “deliberate” parties like those that occurred at the former Kappa Alpha fraternity house, and second, by giving other students the benefit of the doubt and talking to them before filing a LiveSafe report when they make “unintentional” mistakes like Mills and his friends. Whether students will support Mills in this mission and continue to trust in his leadership remains to be seen. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",legacy_html:true,video_path:"",video_replaces_photo:false,show_comments:false,template:"jackbuehner2020",layout:"standard"},{_id:"60fb4f208903ad2774afdb0a",name:"Chair of Furman Health Sciences Department Offers Perspective on Public Health Risk",slug:"chair-of-furman-health-sciences-department-offers-perspective-on-public-health-risk",timestamps:{published_at:"2020-08-29T06:00:00.000Z"},people:{authors:[{_id:"60df7c4f59fe1d47b0621616",name:"Lauren Krotz",slug:"lauren-krotz",photo:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-profile-photos.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Flauren-krotz-2021-03-21.jpg"}]},categories:["news"],tags:[],description:"To continue to live and learn on campus this semester rests on your ongoing commitment to uphold these guidelines and requires all of us to come together to care for and protect one another.",photo_path:"https:\u002F\u002Fpaladin-photo-library.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u002F5f4a56cb4183113b1eda88ad_The2.jpeg.jpg",photo_caption:"Dr. Natalie The, Chair of Furman's Health Sciences Department.",photo_credit:"Furman News",body:"\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the Aug. 27 Furman Focused update on the Kappa Alpha chapter’s interim suspension, \u003Cem\u003EThe Paladin \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ereached out to the chair of the health sciences department, Dr. Natalie The, to hear her thoughts on the effects these events have for campus health and safety. &nbsp;Dr. The shared her statement both as chair of the health sciences department and as an epidemiologist. Her full statement can be read below, but readers should be mindful that it is Dr. The’s own perspective and may or may not represent the views of other Health Sciences faculty members. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer statement: \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EAs a faculty member, I had started to hear some things from various sources earlier this week about a gathering last weekend. I am deeply concerned with the recent news that there were indeed large social events during a pandemic. We now know the immediate impact of the events with 53 students who are under quarantine for potential exposure to COVID. I am concerned for the physical well-being of these potentially exposed students and the other student(s) who have a COVID positive diagnosis. While we know certain individuals are at higher risk for more severe consequences of COVID, young, healthy individuals still have some risk of experiencing serious consequences. We also have students who may be at higher risk of COVID complications including those with immune conditions, current asthma, those who vape\u002Fsmoke and many other conditions. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EI am also concerned about the longer-term impacts of such a gathering. If any of the individuals who attended the party and were exposed, this will result in additional exposures to their close contacts such as roommates and potentially their families if they leave to quarantine at home or even Furman faculty and staff who may be at higher risk of experiencing serious consequences. The type of events that were held last weekend were precisely the same events that are impacting other universities and their decisions to transition from an in-person to fully remote learning experience, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The domino effect of the party will be more clearly known in the coming days. From an optimistic perspective, I hope that none of the 53 individuals test positive, there are no subsequent secondary or tertiary COVID infections and our university will not have to shift course in response to last weekend’s event. Alternatively, we could be forced to follow the footsteps of UNC and others who have been forced to end in-person instruction. We will begin to understand the full ramifications and consequences of last weekend’s events soon. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EI understand that our students want and need to gather with their peers and friends – it’s part of the normal college experience and some of the fondest memories of my own college experience. Gatherings provide social support that is important for social and mental well-being. The current times are stressful on so many levels and these events represent a way in which students can connect and feel normal. Students need to find and engage in socially safe activities such as calling, video chats or \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esmall\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E outdoor gatherings, like in grassy areas with a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esmall\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E group of friends while maintaining six feet from those who are not living in the same apartment or dorm room. Students should still wear a mask in these situations. Unfortunately, a pandemic does not allow us to have our usual social events. I do not know whether alcohol was officially involved in the social event last weekends. I have concerns that it was, and we know alcohol lowers inhibition and the ability to effectively follow COVID guidelines. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EI recognize that the many rules and procedures in place due to COVID are challenging. No one enjoys the lack of normalcy. No one enjoys wearing a mask. No one enjoys physical distancing. No one wants a long swab stuck in their nose. No one wants to be in quarantine or isolation for two weeks. Public health research also clearly demonstrates that wearing masks and physical distancing are highly effective ways of mitigating and slowing the spread of COVID. We also must test to have an accurate picture of what is happening on campus. Seeking testing off campus and failing to communicate positive results could result in the transition to remote learning for everyone. I know students are concerned about sharing positive test results with Furman as this would result in student isolation for two weeks. No one wants that either, but if a student who has a COVID positive diagnosis reports their status to the Earle Student Health Center, Furman can begin to contact trace, quarantine and isolate. If we can follow appropriate protocols, the student who has gone home for two weeks will get to come back for their on-campus experience because Furman is able to mitigate campus risk. Failure to communicate with Furman will only continue the domino effect and could result in the transition to remote learning. &nbsp; \u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EThere is so much information that is available on Furman Focused. I also recognize that there is so much information on the webpage that keeping track of all of it is challenging. If you can remember nothing of what’s on that page, below I’ve highlighted important guidelines outside of the classroom. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E1. &nbsp; &nbsp; \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPractice physical distancing\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of at least six feet apart (think two arms lengths apart) with anyone who you do not reside with even when outdoors. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E2. &nbsp; &nbsp; \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWear a mask anytime you are indoors \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eexcept when you are in your own residence or eating\u002Fdrinking. \u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E3. &nbsp; &nbsp; \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBeing outdoors is not a substitute for physical distancing and masking.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You should still do both while outside.

Or the group that has congregated outside for dinner may be roommates in an apartment who by default are already close contacts. It’s appropriate to remind people kindly to follow guidelines. Shaming is not effective either in person or via social media, and only exacerbates stress, anxiety, and mental health concerns. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EAs encouraging as yesterday’s dashboard numbers may seem, please remember that these numbers are only a snapshot of one moment.
